/* This file is a compatability layer.  It allows the usage of flexible box 
model layouts accross multiple browsers, including older browsers.  The newest,
universal implementation of the flexible box model is used when available (see
`Modern browsers` comments below).  Browsers that are known to implement this 
new spec completely include:

    Firefox 28.0+
    Chrome 29.0+
    Internet Explorer 11+ 
    Opera 17.0+

Browsers not listed, including Safari, are supported via the styling under the

<pre>[&#39;According to HP it is a laptop but it falls under family of Notebook. From dimensions it should be classified as Notebook. Light weight, no DVD player and non replaceable Li-on battery. Good 2.3 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM works well. Windows 10 home opening and closing time normal. HP updates all drivers comfortably and window update works well. Box has only notebook and power chord. We have to get all other including warranty through HP website.I have loaded office pro and everything looks smooth. Display is good in some angles. Sound is ok. Very good key board and track pad. Worth buying for the price we pay.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product received as well be seen at description ...but it sometimes hang at when we start it , hang with chrome browser, hang in playing game, speed is slow but speed of the processor is seing 2.3 GHz but I am dissapointed because its the speed is so slow but why ???\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product was good,excellent laptop in look wise.Unhappy with Amazon facility delivery service. and one more important I got the laptop as per discription mentioned by the seller.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I do not recommend this if you are looking for a mid price range with at least acceptable speed! The speed is irritating!\n&#39;,
 &#39;All is good  yar\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its good in this budget18720\n&#39;,
 &#39;This product can be used for browsing purpose only, if you open 6-7 tabs at the same time this become worst to operate. Battery is not removable and no dvd port and if something happen then whole motherboard needs to replace.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good but not received cashback in HDFC debit cards cashback offer\n&#39;,
 &#39;Feeling very satisfied after using this laptop.Speed is very good, body material also solid.Recommend to purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Lapi is good . It&#39;s fulfill my requirements but where is warranty card bro?\n&#34;,
 &#39;There is no sound in the laptop even after installing necessary drives.Please suggest solution otherwise I will return the item.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazon showing wrong pictures, the keyboard will also have silver colorIf anyone read this review to buy this laptop, it might be useful\n&#39;,
 &#39;I would request customers who have brought items on EMI through SBI card pleasr check your statement details as I had brought this prouduct on EMI of 9666/- including interest but bank is charging additional interest on this. 9666 + 330. Actually if they had to charge then they should have charged either 9666 per month or 9444+interest for three month. I would request Amazon also to look into the matter so that customers can freely use SBI cards for EMI payment.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m reviewing this laptop after 4 month of use.Pros:- Overall looks seems interesting.- Screen size and display is awesome.- 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, 1 RJ45 connector,  USB 3.5 JACK, SD card slot, CD Rom.- With Intel i3 7th gen this laptop works  fine with all applications and  browsing experience is too good.Cons:- You need to wait a minute after starting this laptop to be able to work. Else, it starts to hang.- Full size keyboard. The numeric buttons on the right should not be present.Overall verdict:Decent laptop at this price.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Let me start with my message stating Very unsatisfactory product. It is i3 7th gen with 4gb Ram but it is slower than a celeron processor my other laptop. Infact cant be compared as simple basic task like sending mail cant work in this laptop forget the gaming etc. VERY VERY SLOW . 100% memory and 100 % DISK usage show all the time in if u open task manager.I mailed HP looking at the messages from HP from other reviews. It seemed to be quite promising that someone from HP customer care will take the laptop solve it or replace it sad thing no one even bothered to reply to my mail.So sick HP service.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have purchase this laptop  and use from last 20 days. Performance wise it is very slow .bulky and not comfortable for everyday use.Suggestions : You will get better laptop in the same price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this laptop a day ago.It is mentioned in amazon that this laptop has lifetime validity for ms office.But actually it is not.We need renew it every year.Feeling very very disappointed with Amazon for mentioning a wrong feature.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bloody product doesn&#39;t power on at all... When called customer support they reply so adamantly...\n&#34;,
 &#39;display quality and speed both are very bad.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Kindly update about products it&#39;s original by HP?Find the photos and confirm the same.I am using currently i5 and i3 but this one looking different\n&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m truly satisfied with the performance of the laptop and the battery backup especially considering the cost I paid for this.Also, GET 10% CASHBACK + 6 Month Extended Warranty In this Laptop by Ordering through vqr .in/1Hope this helps! If helped then Please Press the Helpful Button.Happy Purchasing\n&#34;,
 &#39;After 4 Months of Usage writing this review...1.Got it for 19k2.Awesome battery life3.Worth the price\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is not a good product and the the dealer is not authorized according to the HP service centerDear Mr/Ms kumar,STATUS: REQUEST IS CLOSEDDO NOT REPLY to this email.  It is sent from an unmonitored automatic service.

 &#34;Wonderful product for such a price. I got it for an effective price of nearly 17,000 ₹ and I&#39;m delighted to have it.Pros -- Good battery life. Lasts for around 4 hours.- Lightweight.- Doesn&#39;t lag.- Price is great.- Trusted brand.- Durable and excellent for daily use.Cons -- Not suitable for high end gaming.- It is DOS, hence you&#39;ve to install Windows by yourself.\n&#34;,
 &#39;damage laptop received.. very disappointment.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought it for my personal use &amp; i&#39;m surprised how it performs. It&#39;s super lightweight though battery backup isn&#39;t good, might last for 2 hours after a full charge. Switching between tasks is super smooth &amp; no lags even when lots of windows are opened. This is where AMD quad core processor shows its jalwa. I installed windows 10 &amp; it&#39;s working awesome. At this price point its supercool product. I got it next day because i&#39;m a prime subscriber. Others might get it late. Go for it, its a jackpot.Note: do check if its covered by hp warranty because in past many people have faced the issue with hp products bought from Amazon. Hp guys say they wont provide warranty for any product bought from Amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;its not working properly i need to return the laptop urgently , there are lines on the display of laptop, it did work 10 days only. after that we are facing a lot of problems with it, can you please my product or take return, i am requesting you to take return or get repaired .  how can we get warranty of laptop from HP company ,where we go to get repaired.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Lightweight. HP laptop in less than 20K is worth a deal.The only gripe: I bought in offer period, and noticed that the price changed after offer period to a lower one. Not fair Amazon !The warranty was already found to be updated to the month i bought (Sep) of 2018.Was easy to install softwares.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is fine, working good except Bluetooth. Tried all of the drivers from HP downloads. The seller shipped faster. Tried Drivers of Realtek, HP, Broadcom &amp; intel.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Right hand side vertical line on the screen\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop &amp; card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;)\n&#39;,
 &#39;initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Item as described, super fast delivery. Will review the laptop after a few weeks of use.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fast performanceWosrt display\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great Product at a great price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.Good battery time.....Min 5hrsFor office use best one.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is fast, good for regular office/home work.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The Laptop has a decent display, boots fast and does what it should for the price. However, the Microsoft Office mentioned in the listing is a 30-day trial version. However, the vendor conveniently mentions that Microsoft Office is available without providing any hints that it is a trial version.When I called up Amazon Customer Support. I was told -1. The Product only has a 30-day trial and that this has been clarified in an User Answer. There are 4 products and 3 user answers. Completely not appropriate2. I was asked to purchase the license for 8k.This is a complete cause of Deceptive Advertisements by the vendor.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have received it today only.. Done basic set up. Original windows 10 &amp; Ms office 2019(Life Time).System is pretty fast in terms of booting.Those who are complaining about Ms office 2019 for 30 days, first understand how to activate Ms office 2019....1. First create your own outlook I&#39;d like how we are creating in Gmail, Yahoo....2. Then Left side bottom search box, just type  Excel and click the Excel.3. It will ask you to activate.. just click activate and enter your outlook username and password, what you have created or already having.4. Enjoy for life time..5. Meanwhile don&#39;t click office 365, bcz its not for life time...I hope you will enjoyReview after 15 daySystem is superb. It&#39;s very fast in terms of opening Ms office,GC,IE... No lagging...Those who complaining about hanging... Update the system even bios also...Once it&#39;s done you won&#39;t find the lag...Meanwhile don&#39;t expect the speed when you&#39;re booting first time...31/10/19 updateWhen I clicked ❓in the right bottom, opened HP page. Where I got the 4 updates. It seems, it&#39;s very important update for bios, Bluetooth, lan and wifi. Those who are complaining system is slow, this update may helpful...\n&#34;,
 &#39;Dont buy this, in 3 months  of time, hard disk conked off.Laptop is pretty slow .Have to incur an expense of 5k to get a new hard disk.Amazon should have a larger period of return window for sensitive products like laptop.Actually  a loss to buy this laptop from the seller.Better to go with offline stores like Croma or exclusive dealer of the brand.\n&#39;,
 &#34;8GB RAM + 256 GB SSD + i3Windows 10 HomeMS Office Home and Student - Lifetime ( Word + Excel + PP + OneNote )MS Office 365 - One month trialThe above features are good for this price, I got this for 28KGood for Coding and browsingthe boot time is very fast, thanks to the SSD - use your space well, Don&#39;t dump unnecessary files in your PCVery lightweightBattery backup - GoodVideo quality - Good - Integrated graphicsNot great for gamingMy Verdict - If you want a PC for coding and browsing stuff, this one is the best in the budget- No lags literallyBuy a good external drive HDD to store the stuff like movies, songs etc..Screen Quality - decentBattery Life - Very GoodLight weight\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price. Overall just a fine product for browsing but not more.\n&#39;,
 &#34;From the reviews, I purchased this laptop only to regret it later. I contacted amazon for return but they told me a 10-12 step solution to make laptop faster which I implemented. The laptop did become a tad bit faster but returned to being the speed of the first generation computers in the world.Now I am frustrated using it and would highly recommend to not buy this laptop.I don&#39;t know if Amazon can help here. My INR 30000 wasted in this utter disappointment of a product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;superb laptop with win10, ms office, all preloaded and 8gb RAM/ 256 GB SSD. Very quick to boot and no lag. Dropbox giving 27GB space free with this and One drive gives 5 gb space So all one needs is an extended warranty ( bought for 1500 on Amazson) and a optional Pendrive ( bought a 64 GB) for storing documents etc. Bought in exchange so paid Rs.23,236 ( Rs.4760 for old Sony Viao plus some SBI card discount), so really happy with my purchase. Good screen and battery backup. Only miss not having a backlit keyboard, rest all is great!\n&#39;,
 &#34;The HP laptop, 14 inch, light weight and genuine softwares is a perfect combination for anybody who is in search for a decent laptop.After couple of days of working, here is what I found,Pros:1. Windows 10 &amp; MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I&#39;ve reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.\n&#34;,
 &#34;In the first 20 days mouse was not working had to open the laptop and got fixed easily but what&#39;s the point? Also I beleive the HP quality is gone down. This laptop screen  does not open much its just till 90 degree. Also the original pro e shown is high and then it make you feel as if they are giving you high discount but it&#39;s the actual price.. Not happy with the quality\n&#34;,
 &#39;Do not buy hp products... Service is just waste.. To replace a faulty part already 20 days over without any further updates.. This is my experience and if you buy it.. You can experience it also..\n&#39;,
 &#34;I ordered this laptop on May 11 (Saturday) and the product reached to me early morning on May 13 (Monday), so kudos to Amazon&#39;s delivery! I was worried about any damages or scratches, but the laptop was well packed.Coming to the laptop, I&#39;m writing this review after using it extensively for 2 weeks. My review is divided into the pros and cons to cover all the features of this laptop:Pros:1) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.2) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.3) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.4) The touch is brilliant and extremely responsive. The inking pen has a quick response as well. If you&#39;re a designer, the inking pen can act as an added benefit, however, for me, it does not have any other utility than to play around with Paint 3D.5) Multifunctioning is smooth and the laptop doesn&#39;t lag or slow down when switching from one application to another.6) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.7) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.8) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.9) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.10) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn&#39;t feel any change in my typing speed.Cons:1) The screen- The screen is only HD and not FHD, so if you like watching 1080p videos, you won&#39;t get that full HD experience.2) There is no IPS or In-Plane Switching feature. The screen quality shifts with the slightest change, so you need to keep the screen in one angle to enjoy your video content. Even the slightest shift to the angel can lead to a change in contrast and black levels. So, not a comfortable experience overall.3) The volume is fine. It&#39;s not loud enough to play audios and videos for a large room full of people. You&#39;ll need a good speaker for your entertainment.4) The laptop heats up a lot when plugged into charging to a really uncomfortable level. You can&#39;t use the laptop on your lap while it&#39;s charging, especially in summers. I had to put the laptop in front of an Air Conditioner to cool it down a little.5) Though the laptop is sturdy, I&#39;d suggest you avoid using the 2-1 feature multiple times at once. (just saying)Overall, there are more pros than cons of this laptop. The biggest minus point for me is the screen. I focused on the 256 GB SSD and didn&#39;t pay heed to the screen resolution and IPS. But, It&#39;s a good buy and I&#39;m using it for both entertainment and work without any major concerns.This is a really good laptop if you wish to buy a 2-in-1 laptop and have a budget of 40-45k, but you can buy an FHD display with the 14-dh0101TU model that has the same specs as this one. I don&#39;t understand why the 101TU model wasn&#39;t launched with this and launched only a few days after it!\n&#34;,
 &#39;I bought it for my sister, she is a freelancer and I must appreciate the look first. I have used it for few hours and find so much comfortable in using, writing and overall accessibility of it. The built, texture and look of the laptop is quite premium. The touch screen is quick. It turns into a tablet very much quick and keyboards get disabled, so you don;t have to worry about keyboards getting pressed mistakenly while using it as a tablet.It is FHD, the visuals are good. The speed so far I have pretty much enjoyed.I recommend this laptop for students, freelancers, artists, writers and also good for traveling.It could be bit more lightweight but then, the cost must be high, so I give it that.the pen works cool. I am going to try more of it over the months, then see how it goes further.Overall, It is a must buy considering the price, brand, specifications, value for money and overall what you are getting here. If you want more specifications, you can go for i5 version or 8GB RAM version, but this model overall is cool\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a preliminary review as I have just received the laptop and played on it for a day. It looks beautiful and slim. 2 in 1 looks very good, as a tablet with inking technology, it is amazing. Pen is good, it will be better to add a screen guard as we need to force the touch of the pen to the screen. This is my first i3 as I have always used i5 or i7, speed seems to be fine but have to see after loading bunch of software. SSD hard disk will be definitely a boost, planning to throw another 4gb ram stick to make it 8gb to compensate i3 performance. So far so good, will update later.First edit:It does not have backlit keyboard and modifying hardware like adding RAM or adding bigger SSD is very difficult in this model, just found all X360 hp laptops are compact and tightly packed like mobile phones. Battery is placed inside and could not be replaced easily like other or older hp laptops. This is definitely an inconvenience for people who are computer savvy and keep updating their laptops.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I think, It&#39;s a great deal and works like a charm. I was skeptical before buying this but overall it is a good buy if your budget is between 40k-50k as it comes with corei3 8th Gen,MS Office, Windows 10,360 degree, Tablet and touch screen with pen.. so what else we need..I did not feel any slowness as well so far.. However this review is based on 3 days of use.. so wait and see if someone is writing after a month.. but we can buy it👍\n&#34;,
 &#34;first thing first -performance of this machine is same as an i3 with ssd has to be -no complaints there. Its a Very good looking laptop. you will surely love it.But Biggest letdown is display. Let me tell you that if you are considering a laptop then look for full HD display.this one has HD display which provides so so images. The let down by display is visible all over.more to that the Glass on display is pathetic-as it reflects everything . It makes viewing so difficult that it keeps you annoyed all the time.i will update more as i get  more of it.UPDATE:- i am using it now for a considerable time.My biggest complaint was display and let me admit honestly that i am now used to it. i do not find it that annoying. But yes, i would still suggest to go for FHD laptop with few bucks more.Actually HP should have given FHD at this price point.(i bought this at 43K).Touch screen is gd. i am not using the Stylus at all,i think this will be case with every other customers. (samsung Galaxy Note owners know it well).the stylus -its there , because its just there,actual use is minimal.). So while purchasing don&#39;t get distracted with HP pen. its not an advantage unless you really require it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I m very much satisfied with laptop...fine touch screen....stylus pen working excellent........keyboard very sleek......video quality up to the mark...works very well for writing taking notes.....browsing is very fast....got it for 40700 on prime day\n&#39;,
 &#39;I got the laptop for 42990 which is a fair deal and as usual Amazon is awesome. First let me give you the cons.Cons:1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) the viewing angles could have been better.Now the pros:1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is inlclude.Overall worth it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Initially I had an issue with activation of Office. Very pleased with feedback provided on my review. Was able to activate MS Office. It does come with MS installed and usable. Hence changed the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.The unit is very lightweight. I was looking for a reasonably priced 2 in 1. Overall a very good value for money. The 4 GB of RAM seems a bit insufficient. Else, it serves my purpose of using the system mainly for documentation, spreadsheets and presentations. Yet to try out the pen..EARLIER INITIAL REVIEW.... Changed as above!!!By reading product details we get the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. The product details etc. are to be changed to clearly indicate this.Note: We just got the delivery last evening. The review will be changed if in case we find the activation key or if the seller provides the same.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Works like a charm on the very first day, hopefully it stays so, amazing looking lappy at an affordable price, go for it and pray for the guys we’re in good mood while packing it, just like for mine\n&#39;,
 &#39;With the best options for a student, with silent and fast flash-drive based operation, this is a great buy. We paired it with an external 21&#34; HP monitor and USB Keyboard/Mouse set to make it an excellent desktop at home and portable laptop away from home.. Legal Windows-10 and MS-office-home-student version makes it even more of a value proposition..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Usually i dont give stars below than 4 ...but this time its really forced me to give it ine star....... The performance of system is too bad ... Even after 8 gb ram and 7 gen ...its tooo slow ..... Takes forever to load os ...take years to open refresh ... Just stum on screens ...Will not suggest to buy this laptop .\n&#39;,
 &#34;1.From the beginning, the computer kept rebooting and the cursor got stuck,first every 5mins and then every one minute, so frequently that after seeing the logo HP the screen would flicker and computer start rebooting immediately.The cycle would go on for couple of times, then the window says Windows Not Properly Installed. Options given below: Advanced troubleshooting and Shut Down  The computer came with windows installed,but from day1, it&#39;s been saying Windows not properly installed and rebooting and the screen flickering.2. The specifications before buying said With MS Office installed, and when you open and check you find subscription is for only 30days.3. Graphics are poor when it&#39;s supposed to be a full HD computer.4. I have lost all trust on electronic products bought from Amazon. You should have an option for Return not just Exchange or give a free troubleshooting service.Even though I have bought an extended warranty, I don&#39;t have the time to wait and call for service every few days.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The HP 15q 0026tu is an excellent budget laptop with Good quality of Performance and Battery life.Battery avg - 5 to 6hourSound quality- Good quality ( at 70 below)Performance- GoodBoot time -1 minutes and lessBuild quality- BetterCons:No Ms office original version only trail version for 30 days.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Lap seems sooper smooth while initial setup. Doesn&#39;t felt any lag issue like other people claim in their review.. not much satisfied about battery life , thats y 4 giving 4 star. Bt overall it is the best one available in market for this price range.. i opt to purchase this one after 10 days of enquiries and web searches.. it doesnt make me disappointed.. thanks to amazone.. in hp support ,found it is a genuine lappy 😍Review after 2 months -. I just gave one more star and now it is 5 star. Overall pefomance is awesome.. only one problem when creating new folder it lags ore few sec.  Those who felt the system is slow, kindly uninstall useless pre-installed softwares especially mcafee antivirus and install avast free or any other antivirus.. now your problem solved.. u can have a sooper smooth lappy.. enjoy 😍🔥\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very bad experience.  System is booting very slow. Bigger than mentioned. No performance of 8 gb. Requested for replacement.  Amazon denied it. Asked me to go to service centre.  Same day of delivery I am asked to go to service centre to repair.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I like the laptop it has an SSD+HDD option and RAM upgrade option I have upgraded with 256 SSD and 8 GB RAm Now laptop has 16 Gb RAM with 256 GB SSD for OS and 1 TB for Storage. laptop work flawlessly... Awesome purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#39;If you are looking for a no-frills laptop, this is the one. Looks ok, works like a charm, good keypad and overall ticks all boxes. If you compare it to a laptop twice its price, obviously you will be disappointed. This is a WagonR and looks and works like one .  Do not expect to work and look like Honda City or anything higher. Period.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good packing from Amazon... neat and safe... immediately after receiving I thought it was refurbished... but after using for a month... I feel it is a good product... battery and sound quality is satisfactory\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased this item 28th January but due to some argent work I could not use it within return time. This is defected product . Some keys are not working. And very slow process\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is the best laptop in budget range with good battery back up and light weight. I am using Photoshop, image ready and premier without any lag. I bought 8GB varient which helping me boosting performance. I was using Lenovo G560 model with 8GB RAM but it weighs more.  Conclusion: Go for this laptop if your budget is within 35k.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Recieved faulty display . Keyboard impressions on brand new laptop screen. Unbelievable !\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop from a authorized hp product dealers in 53k about a week ago. Laptop has a premium look and it&#39;s blazing fast, thanks to the 256gb ssd. It has a backlight keyboard. I bought this only for programming and watching movies stuff. So far, no complaint.\n&#34;,
 &#39;ProsBoot up time is really fast.ConsThere are heating issues. Laptop hears very fast\n&#39;,
 &#34;I frustrated about this product and delivery service by Amazon. Hated both HP and Amazon. Amazon delivered this product after a week and customer Support guys didn&#39;t know anything about my product, they don&#39;t know proper info about our products which is placed on Amazon. The product delivery time was hectic. I preferred to buy this laptop to protect my data, but it doesn&#39;t have that feature (Windows home edition will not support bit locker and even it will not support device encryption)contacted Microsoft for this issue: they said contact HP and HP customer care is not working even I have LPM 2.0 it&#39;s not workingBattery life is just 3 hoursEventually the laptop is overheatingWindows home edition doesn&#39;t have more features 😫Poor product Quality51k wasted 😔Amazon Please please please please don&#39;t encourage such wrong products and fake sellersAmazon Cons:Product Delivery TimeCustomer SupportDelivery guy contact details are wrongProduct is not genuineServiceHP Cons:Battery lifeOver heatWindows OS Home editionDisk EncryptionPoor Quality of product ☹️LPM 2.0\n&#34;,
 &#34;First time they delivered the laptop the display was defective as it had keyboard imprints in it.otherwise i really like the laptop but i won&#39;t say its the perfect ever.Pros.1)Light weight, compact and has premium look.2) Amazing backlit keyboard.3)good 1080p display4)SSD+HDD+8gb ram which makes it Superfast as well as super useful to store data.5)Decent speaker which is becoming increasingly rare to find.Cons.1) low battery life.2) Does get heated up quickly.i purchased this for academics and coding so i dont regret my purchase at all. but delivering faulty display one first and then replacing to get a new one was a bad experience as i couldn&#39;t complete an assignment on time because i didn&#39;t have a laptop at hand.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is a bad experience with this laptop twice..I have purchased this laptop second time after the replacement of the first one. Both were facing the same issue of keyboard marks inside the screen..,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great product from HP. Got this for 1k less price than here from HP website and also got a free laptop bag. Delivery was super quick (Blue dart)Loved the laptop overall. The SSD makes the experience super smooth. However the keyboard looks cheap and shoddy. Buttons on the chiclet keyboard are clicky and might be announcing to few. Display is great so far, just been a week.Will post a complete review after a month. So far, this is the best non-gaming laptop (from my research) under 55k.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Don’t buy, screen started flickering and switching off on the first day only after 1:30 hours of usage, defective laptops, could not check remaining areas as the screen is blank,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought it 2 weeks back for my regular use. Its a great performer. Super fast speed and very smooth performance. Beautiful, slim and light. Silver shade is bright. Battery life is good.Got it cheaper @ ₹ 44049/- after exchange of my old Samsung laptop (-₹ 5050) from Fast Deal dealer.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Fast Deal.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good one..fast processor, good screen, start up/ shut down in 20sec, built is good, full version microsoft 2019.Had some error msg intially but maybe due to some installtn of software.Took time to submit review just to be doubly sure tht its performing fine...\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop (HP 14q cs0018-tu) for 19k INR in July 2019 on Prime day. It&#39;s really fast because it has an NVMe SSD with read speeds exceeding 1 GB/s! Windows 10 boots in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the cheapest laptop with a fast NVMe SSD (Toshiba KBG30ZMV256G). The Kaby Lake-R Pentium Gold processor 4417U has 2 cores and 4 threads and is more or less equivalent to a Core i3. The laptop is thin and light, and the keyboard is decent. The charging brick is also small and portable with sufficient cable length.The major downside is the screen which is a sub-Full HD (1366x768) panel, but that&#39;s quite OK considering the price point. The other downside I noticed is that the two speakers are not symmetrically placed, but that&#39;s just nit picking.Overall, I&#39;m really happy with this laptop. It&#39;s great for web browsing, productivity/office work, and light programming.  Easily the best laptop in the 20k INR segment and will handily beat more expensive laptops that have a 5400 rpm HDD.\n&#34;,
 &#39;First of all, I got this for about Rs 19200 and I will be  reviewing as per that price.The body is plastic but not that shiny plastic HP usually provides that gets scratched easily.1. Display is Fine. Not too good or bad.2. Keyboard is fine again. No backlit keyboard as expected for the price.3. Mouse pad is a bit slow but you can always increase the sensitivity.4. Gesture support is there.5. Battery Life is good. I charged the laptop to 100 and watched Netflix offline for 2 hours on full brightness and earphones. The battery then dropped to 85. SO YOU CAN EXPECT GOOD BACKUP6. GAMING: I played basic games like GTA Vice City and it ran fine as expected.7. SSD: OMG! This makes a huge difference. The PC boots in about 5 seconds. Even though the storage is only 256GB but it is worth it as it makes the laptop faster that my other HP with i5 8th gen processor8. You get 2 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0, 1 Ethernet, 1 HDMI, 1 headphone jack, 1 SD card reader as ports.9. Speakers are good. Not too loud nor too tiny.10. I think it has a small fan. I did not face any heating issues.11. Webcam is there of OK qualityOverall a very good buy under 20K. I would definitely recommend this product\n&#39;,
 &#34;Got this for 19k on prime day deal. Good laptop for school students. 256gb ssd, reasonable processor 4417U which is power efficient. RAM is 4gb, I will upgrade later. Resolution is only 720p, but can&#39;t complain at this price.Overall highly recommed this. Looks and feels like premium laptop.Windows 10 is great. This laptop does not come with latest 1903 build. Easily updatable via windows update.First thing you do after setuo, uninstall mccafe software. No need for it, use windows defender, built in antivirus software.Also uninstall other crapware like dropbox, hp apps etc.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Just received the laptop. Everything is  expected. Display so smooth and sharp. Loving it. Windows and office both got activated. Thin &amp; really light. Booting is slow actually don&#39;t know why. Will write a review again in couple of days. Go for it!\n&#34;,
 &#34;\xa0I had great hopes from this laptop. And I really needed it to work as expected, as a laptop is crucial for my business. But it stopped working within 4 days of receiving and now I&#39;m stuck, for god knows how long.I hope it gets more negative ratings to show everyone what it truly is....garbage.Bottomline: Avoid buying cheap laptops from Amazon.You get what you pay for!\n&#34;,
 &#39;Pros:- This is a good entry level laptop with super compact build quality- Very light laptop and easy to carry- The keypad is great, comes with 1-month subscription of McAfee and also comes with Office 2019 School edition- Sound quality, picture quality are all top class. Very good for home usage and light office work- Good options on the touchpadCons:- No touch screen- No backlit keyboard- No extendable memory slot to raise to 16 GB RAM\n&#39;,
 &#39;Faster than the high end laptops. it is because of SSD technology used.Tried watching 1080p videos from youtube. no lag in anywhere.sound quality is good in headphones. speakers are ok for normal use.boot time is at its best. less than 10 seconds.battery lasts more than expected. around 4-5 hours for moderate use.no cd drive is there. that is not required nowadays. so not an issue.windows 10 home and student is installed and activated for lifetime.no heating spotted during the operation. this is because of SSD i think.webcam is good for normal chats. not a HD one. but still good.display is not HD. but still good for watching movies.never tried playing any games.weight is less compared to other laptops in this range.one downside is the office version is trial only. need to pay around 8k for lifetime license.PS:please uninstall the mcafee and other junk softwares first on first boot itself. windows defender is good enough to protect the pc.Price is oscillating in amazon. track via eoffersindia to get the price drop alert and then buy.\n&#39;,
 &#34;All these seems a good customized specifications for fast performance because of 256GB SSD PCIe NVMe SSD. The NVMe SSD is even faster and advanced than normal SSD. So understand the difference. So this HDD is more fast in SSD&#39;s.But as per the description,  there is no DVD Drive. Please beware of that.Pros:1.Thin2.Handy and weight less.3.Full HD.4.Sound is good.5.Fast/Prompt Responsive.6.PCIe NVMe SSDCons:1.No Keyboard Back light.2.No DVD Writer.3.Microsoft Product activation not working properly for few devices.4.When using high volumes, speakers getting cracking sound.5. No VGA slot. (Very few people still use, not much issue).6. No USB C-Port.7. No USB 3.1Let&#39;s see how it work&#39;s moving ahead.Overall Best Buy for working professionals with decent performance because of 256GB SSD PCIe NVMe SSD.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Bought this as my back to college laptop and it didn&#39;t disappoint. My all friends are considering this I just bought another 1tb ssd with this and whole set up just took off.Played whole assassin&#39;s Creed black flag a little lag but certainly playable.Also all of my engineering softwares run smoothly never experienced any lag(except sucky WiFi at my college)Overall best laptop for 20k and buy another HDD you&#39;ve got production power house in budget.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It was delivered as oer promised date and product was in good condition. I am hoping HP is good brand and recepient will make best use of same\n&#39;,
 &#34;I Ordered this lap on 17 sep and received on 21 morng.Worst delivery experience by amazon. And coming to the laptop its amazing even Better than my expectations.AMD Ryzen 3 awesome processor definitely lot better than i3 series.Its good for gaming im using it for almost 3 days its performance was very smooth and quick , im starting to wondering how they gave it for 28000. dell ryzen 3 laptop are giving it for 40000.Ryzen is giving pure graphical performance.If ur looking for midrange gaming laptop go for its best in this segment. Some guys are giving bad reviews about that dont get confused.If u utilities its full hardware and software facilities thn ur gng to love this.ill give some additional informationPros:1 Amd ryzen processor its have better multi thread performance when compare to intel i3good for gaming2 Performance u can run highend game&#39;s in this.if u upgrade ur ram to 8 GB it will run like a pro3 you have m2 slot for SSD4 Fast charging it takes around 45 min to charge 50% and battery is inbuilt5 its coming with Windows 10 life time validity.6 Comes with DVD drive and smooth finished coating.7 Light weight only 2 kg8 Price Best in segment.Cons:1 just a HD display not FHD2 Battery last upto 7 to 8hrs apprx in gaming  6 to 7hrs3 Yeah its Heating up little bit but not much.if ur well-known guy abt processor u come to know that heating and battery fast draining its a major issues for AMD.its default but im not worrying abt that .intel also have a heating problems and Ryzen is a next level processor from amd its handling heat and battery quite good compared to other AMD.laptop so don&#39;t worry abt heating.I strongly recommend this for u too\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop was great value for money Since I exchanged my old laptop. If you can buy this laptop under 23k , just go for it. You won’t regret it. There are many upgrade options available for this laptop So that you can improve the performance of this laptop. I didn’t find any other laptop where I can upgrade to Nvme m.2 SSD.So I was testing my laptop for the last few weeks without the upgrade and it was performing well. But there was some issues with the gaming, Photoshop and continues browsing with many tabs opened.Then I upgraded to WD green m.2 240Gb SSD (sata speed) and migrate the Windows OS to the SSD with the WD OS Clone tool which is available on the WD website. It did shows a significant improvement in the performance. The browsing, photoshop cc speed increased but not the gaming fps. Bought it form Md computers (online) for Rs 3500.If you have the budget go for Samsung 970 evo( Samsung 860 evo for low price).The boot time was reduced to 10sec, for HDD it was around 26sec , for SSD it was 16 sec.I tried to play GTA 5 on SSD , the loading time was reduced but it’s not playable even at lowest graphics settings.Then I upgraded the ram since 3Gb of my ram was always used by the OS, So I installed ADATA 4GB DDR4 2400Mhz ram for Rs 3000 , it really improved overall performance of the laptop. Ram is now running on Dual channel.The laptop came with Samsung M471A5244CB0-CTD Ram which was capable of running at 2666Mhz ,but the laptop motherboard only support 2400Mhz Ram. I opt the help of HP forum and a computer expert to find the best compatible ram for the laptop because there is a chance of some compatibility issues.I would say if you are buying any other ram other than ADATA  AD4S2400J4G17-R , Make sure that you take the laptop to a technician so that even if the ram doesn’t support you still won’t loose your money.I tried to buy online, but if it doesn’t support means I can’t return the product.Now I can play GTA 5 with average 30fps at low settings,No photoshop editing lag ,applying filters and other effects.Pros:AMD RYZEN 3 performance is very goodCan be upgraded to nvme m.2 SSD (Samsung 970 evo the best)No overheating issues.Good viewing angle.Activated windows 10 HomeFast chargingCons:Battery life max 4hrsTouchpad not preciseNo backlit keyboardSpeakers averageRam and SSD slot not easily accessible\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ordered it as a work laptop. Very nice battery life. Excellent picture. Slight hesitation when loading graphics intensive Power Point.NOT a gaming laptop. An excellent work horse for traveling for businessAlso, Get 10% Cashback on this or Any Laptop by Ordering through vqr.in/83.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have upgraded the RAM to 8 GB. The RAM specification that you need is DDR4 2400 Mhz SDRAM. There are 2 slots, so adding another RAM isnt an issue. Dont try to open the laptop yourself as its not easy, take it to someone who knows HP laptops well. The responsiveness of the laptop has improved tremendously with this RAM addition. In case someone needs further enhancement of the performance, I would recommend adding an SSD as M2 slot is available but I didnt find the need as of now. Adding the picture of the RAM that I installed\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros:Ryzen 3 with Vega graphicsSupport up to 16gb ramDedicated M2 slot for ssdPreloaded OSAll the needed portsValue for money bought it for 22k after all discounts.Con:Worst screen of allVery slow HDDExperience and suggestion:On the initial days the performance was ok and sometimes slow.Uninstalled Mcafe and using windows defenderBest part is having addition ram and m2 slotSo 1st installed 8gb ram but didn’t see any performance improvement.Then went with 240gb wd green Sata 3 sad and cloned the os there voila OS loads in a second.So at 30k now have 12gb ram 240gb ssd 1tb hdd ryzen 3 what else u can ask.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Before buying this laptop, I was using a notepad that would last over 8 to 10 hours when fully charged. So, this time, I was looking for a laptop that could stay up and working for a good amount of time. This product - HP 15 AMD Ryzen 3 15.6-inch Laptop (4GB/1TB HDD/Windows 10 Home/Sparkling Black/2.04 kg - is being sold promising that it has 13 hours long battery. Well, that is absolutely false. I am a writer. So, my basic needs (applications) on a laptop/computer are - Ms Word, Ms Excel, Paint, Google Chrome, Firefox Browser. I barely watch movies/YouTube on it. I don&#39;t play games on it. But, it&#39;s battery exhausts in just 5 to 6 hours. Talking about other features, it is very quite fast. If you have got fast data connection, websites will load in a blink. Sound quality is great. When I received this laptop, I played a few songs on it. It was an awesome experience. But, my friends, if you are looking for a laptop with a long lasting battery, this is certainly not a good to go option.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Best thing about this laptop is processor which performs almost the same as i3 8th gen at a significantly cheap price. Got it for 22k. 3k extra for 4gb ram Module as 4 gb is not sufficient for Windows 10. Many who complained about laptop being slow should upgrade to 8 gb. It has changed the response drastically. No more hang ups. Adding a ssd could do wonders though have not added one yet.Edit. Finally decided to add a ssd drive. bought WD Green 120 GB M2 drive for Rs. 2280 from amazon. Added it myself. Now the speed difference is apparent in test results. system boots in 15 secs as compared to 40 secs earlier. responses have become much better. the reading speeds are good but writing not so great. I would suggest if you can spend more go for WD blue or Samsung Evo 860. they are more expansive but have writing speeds in the range of 500MB/S. WD Green is for budget users and I feel satisfied with the performance for the price paid.Edit 2 - Many were complaining about battery backup not as expected. Initially when i was using wifi and at moderate brightness i was getting 4-5 hours max. but once you turn off wifi and use it for moderate works like watching movies(not ultra 4k resolution but upto 1080p or 720p) the backup is around 6-7 hours. and while working on word excel etc backup is up to 10 hours usually. Turning off WiFi saves a lot of battery.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Guys laptop is very good .just buy a 4gb ram and ssd slot then lappy will perform like anything .Wd ssd from amazon is available for 2300 rs buy it but check the version of ssd which fits this lappy.i got it for 22k after cash back worth it.Very fast .Touch pad is good.Battery last 4hrs with full browsing but its got fast charging so its good for me\n&#39;,
 &#34;The delivery was quick , got it for a good price in amazon sale .The laptop looks quite good and also I am able to open laptop with one hand which is great  .Coming to display it&#39;s average and can&#39;t expect more .The processor amd 3 ryzen 2200 u is good and easily comparable to intel i3 7th Gen .4gb Ram is enough for basic tasks but you definitely need to upgrade to 8gb if planning to do anything more and trust me the performance after that would be great .The additional bonus is m2 slot for SSD , you can install a SSD along with ur 1tb HDD and install windows in SSD and the the magic and speed .One thing I did not like in the laptop is the sound , its low compared to other standards and the sound cracks  in high pitch voices , I ve tried updating the drivers and checking sound settings but no use .Still it&#39;s not very noticeable so I passed it and did not return the laptop.If ur looking for a upgradable laptop with good processor under a budget go for it , but only buy it in a sale , never pay 30 k for this .If budget permits definitely concider upgrading to ssd and atleast 8gb more ram , it will give significant speed boost .Have not tried any games , will update after testing\n&#34;,
 &#34;After Using More Than a Month here is my Review.  This Hp Model only supports Windows 10. You can&#39;t install windows 7 you will get an error of Acpi is not Fully support, contact BIOS vendor. (my Bios are upto date as per vendor).For Linux Environment  Wifi will not Supported. You need buy a seperate wifi adaptor dont buy this if you are intend to use for Ubuntu or Kali Linux or any linux environment, Graphics  managable just ok.you will only get 250+MB video Ram which is worst part , you can&#39;t work o  adobe programs properly. Battery  backup is 3hrs only. Watched a full movie (2hr15minutes) at 100%  and after finishing 20% remained. Camera quality is GOOD. Display Reflects a lot not friendly. Has some Graphics driver problem which supplier doesn&#39;t accept when i gave feedback. You will get bsod error when some applications use graphics (thats not application problem at all ) purely manufacturer defect which they don&#39;t accept. Now for the Windows 10 google to disable so much of bloatware which will increase battery and performance. Use the dark mode available in personalization.  My rating 2/5 for medium type users. 4/5 for normal users.\n&#34;,
 &#39;If you like to analyse for hours/days/weeks even, before buying a product, especially the technical stuff, then this review\&#39;s helpful for you.To be honest, I was super scared to buy this. I know HP has a good reputation, but there was hardly any review regarding this product and not any detailed one. Plus I bought it during Diwali sale so the time was running. And the purchase was to be made in prepaid manner since Amazon doesn\&#39;t allow COD on products costing this much, and there is no return but only replacement allowed on this laptop, so YIKES! Thankfully I did my homework for whole 2 days, learnt the basics of buying a laptop (type of ram I would prefer. what processor, battery strength, etc.) and searched around a lot and decided that this was the one I could get for greatest value at lowest price (Anyone else who is technologically disabled as I am, please refer to Amazon\&#39;s laptop buying guide - that helped me a lot to understand what I want on my own and compare various models to narrow down on the one according to my priorities).Quality of laptop:Looks 9/10: I love the silver and textured look that this lappy gives off. The one star I deducted was because I have been told that the keyboard has been an issue for few customers because the letters are printed in dark gray. so there is not much of contrast. This wasn\&#39;t an issue with me, coz I am already a fast typist and can type without continuously searching on keyboard. Please look at the images of the keyboard I have attached with this review and judge for yourself.Is it a fast laptop?: 9/10 Damn yes! Obviously during the initial setup it took quite a few minutes. After doing that, this lappy is super fast. I am a research scholar. I don\&#39;t indulge in gaming right now. But I almost always have like 20-30 tabs open simultaneously for weeks or months together. So far, this lappy with its 8 gb ram seems to function efficiently even though I\&#39;ve got 10 tabs open right now. I deducted 1 star because I want to see if this will behave the same way after heavy usage. I will update this again after a few months of usage and change the rating accordingly.How\&#39;s the battery?: 8/10 It came with a 39% charged one. I charged it to 100% and plugged it out. I have been watching videos online and downloading and browsing study stuff for the past 1 hour and it only reduced to 85% and that is doable for me. Happy with this one, coz no particular specification is mentioned related to battery usage in the specifications except for 3-cell battery mention (I asked my tech friend about this and he had said it should work upto 6 hours with regular browsing). I deducted 2 stars because of my own jealousy, coz another laptop by HP is available in the touchscreen series at same price with claim of 7 hours battery life in average and upto 13 at max. I gave that up for this, because my friend has had a touchscreen one, and the reflective surface is simply horrifying - too reflective, super sensitive, not at all visible from side angles/if you are standing at a peripheral position. Anyway, I hope this one does me prouder. 2 stars deducted also because laptops with 7-8 hours battery life are available at the same price. I will update it again after I check when the battery drains completely after heavy usage.The screen: 9.5/10! The only reason I was hesitant about was because I did not want a reflective surface screen - those are absolute headaches, my eyes hurt plus I get super scared looking at my own reflection after watching a horror movie (ha!). Anyway, this product surprised me with exactly what I wanted - a MATTE screen!! Not a screen skin/guard but the screen itself! In the specifications it was mentioned that a standard LED backlit screen\&#39;s available, so I thought I was settling. But this was such a pleasant surprise. The matte screen does not reflect, the glare\&#39;s low even if I increase the brightness plus really contributes to the laptop\&#39;s aesthetics. Then why didn\&#39;t I rate this 10/10? Because I am greedy and I really like if when the LCD covers the whole of screen. I am not really fond of the black body around a screen. Basically I like the TV look on a laptop (if that makes sense), a higher screen to body ratio. But at this price? Steal this!Sound: 8/10 The sound is sooooooo much better than I expected. Clear and loud too. I deducted 2 stars, coz well, like I said I am a greedy girl and the louder it is, the better!Ease of navigating Windows 10: 10/10 My tech friend had advised me not to go for Windows 10 coz it lags/hangs. I am super glad that I chose not to listen to him. I have been using Windows 7 professional up to now. So I was a little nervous to switch. But the transition is super smooth. Everything is easier to find and access.MS Office 2019 version: 9/10 I am a PhD scholar. So you can imagine the value of this for me. I wasn\&#39;t willing to compromise on this version. But when I tried to activate, it was showing that only Office 365 version can be activated on this, nothing about the 2019 version. So I had a mini heart attack. After 5 mins of trying to use Office 365 version though, automatically a notification came up that prompted me to update the current version to Office Home and Student 2019 version (Phew!).I love the Microsoft Search feature they are showing off right now though. I deducted 1 star because I have received this lappy a week ago. I wanna use this for a longer period of time and update in case any issue comes up with this.Why buy this online instead of offline? At the same price, I was getting an offer to buy HP laptop with same specifications except for 4 gb ram and free goodies like headphones, bags, usb lights, pendrives, etc. But those over a 8 gb ram at the same price? Are you kidding me? This is a no brainer. You can buy the goodies yourself for under 1200 INR. But having a new ram of 4 gb difference plus the installation charges that would be charged to change/modify the old processor would amount at least up to 4k. Now it\&#39;s a matter of priorities. Goodies vs better processor aka speed.I HAD ONE ISSUE WITH MY LAPTOP MODEL THOUGH:On the keyboard. above 2 number button &#34;@&#34; icon was made, but whenever I tried to press it, inverted comma/&#34; appeared and &#34;@&#34; appeared when I pressed &#34; button. I thought this was a malfunction in the hardware? Maybe the icons got misplaced? I know it is a small matter. But oh well, my mind\&#39;s been wired to the traditional keyboard style and I wasn\&#39;t looking to experiment with it. After an hour though, it became okay (o.O ??) Like it was supposed to in the first place. This is strange and sounds weird. Anyway, why I mentioned this here is if this happens to you, give it an hour or so and keep using your laptop normally. If it still doesn\&#39;t get resolved like mine did (by magic?), then do contact the customer support of Amazon or ask for a replacement if it irks you enough.Thanks for reading my lengthy review!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst laptop. Writing after 1 month of use,. Battery is not up to mark,no keyboard light,  running max 3 hrs. speed is below avg, highly not recommended. I gifted to brother.. he is student that&#39;s why i m not returning.. dont buy if u r IT professional. worst laptop ever from HP\n&#34;,
 &#39;The system Hangs... the ms office is trial version\n&#39;,
 &#39;Packing is worst, when i took parcel the packing box of amazon is already opened. But the inside HP product packing is very good, laptop is very nice.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Using since a month and no issues found.I recommend it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good for normal personal use\n&#39;,
 &#39;good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Gud\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is looking good but it perform little slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good quality product\n&#39;,
 &#34;Overall 1/5 rating. I am working with Amazon to return this PC (not easy to return....pathetic process...they send some1 to check if you are speaking truth or false) because wifi adapter (Realtek RTL 8723DE802.11 B/G/N PCIe Adapter doesn&#39;t work on 5GHz Airtel/ Reliance wifi. So if internet goes (obviously its going to happen) faster, laptop is not going to work. Unfortunately this information is hidden and not mentioned anywhere in technical specs. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP. Other cons: Big, heavy, no- touch screen, no SSD, normal HDD.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Decent laptop but the wireless adaptor supports only b/g/n band only. So can connect only to 2.4GHz signal and get max 40MBPs speed. Even if you have a high speed / 100 MBPS connection, you will not be able to connect.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I feel worth buying such a nice HP laptop in that budget.Everything was working fine.Sound quality was good and battery charged with 99% was lasting for 6hrs.I feel I made a good decision by spending money on a good product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop is good from every angle.  Price is reasonable. However, I had a bad experience with amazon. My laptop warranty started 6 months prior to my purchase date. I wrote to amazon for 9 times. Every time in their answer, amazon gave me promise to sort it out &amp; mentioned that my problem is genuine. After 15 days of my 1st mail they formed committee to sort out my problem. After 1 month,  amazon committee passed resolution that I should contact HP company for warranty &amp; they have nothing to do with my problem. I wrote them, I purchased  laptop from amazon , so  amazon should do correspondence with HP. But amazon did not agree.  Ultimately I started correspondence with hp. HP was very practical &amp; resolved my problem with single mail.\n&#39;,
 &#34;This laptop full series has problem. While creating new folder system it hangs. I returned this laptop twice but still same problem was available.so finally I returned and decided to buy different lappy.  It&#39;s speed is not as par with specifications. Boot time is more.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is a pretty pathetic piece of hardware I have ever used,1. Very poor performance even with 8GB RAM, the laptop takes ages to login and display your desktop. Often, simple programs like Chrome becomes unresponsive. One has to restart the program.2. Keyboard and mouse pad placement are not at all ergonomic and is very uncomfortable to use. The keys are hard to press and not at all intuitive due to placement.3. No back-lit keyboard, which are now standard in laptops in this price range4. The McAfee virus expired within few days even when it says it is 3 months free5. I purchased additional warranty, but HP just refused it without any reason\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery is draining very quickly even at hybernate mode.. processing is too slow..cannot run even 2 applications together smoothly.. looks like old laptop I bought with a new body only.. pathetic experience..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hopeless service by Amazon. They delivered laptop today. It is not loaded. I am not able to start it immediately. After following the voice commands I reached to a stage where it is asking for phone no to connect it to laptop. Even after putting this info not able to move ahead. This is completely disappointing. Now customer service and tech support team of Amazon is asking me to contact HP support team to get help. Pathetic service support.\n&#39;,
 &#39;When i checked in HP support assistant it shows only 7 months warranty remaining,this is bad impact to me\n&#39;,
 &#39;If u want a laptop within 45000 then this is the best one. Works very smoothly and it can support 2160p. Which is Awsm..you get 30 days free mcafee trial. Battery life is excellent. But the front facing cam is not so good. You get office 2016 installed.. MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT......\n&#39;,
 &#34;NOTE :@ Its Available on other Online stores as well, so check before you purchase.@ This model don&#39;t have Touchscreen, so note that.For using this device for couple of weeks, following are the observations from Normal User point of view.First I am mentioning the Specs and then I will explain the User Experience.Following are the Specifications :------------------------------------------# Intel® Core™ i3-7020U processor# 1 TB storage, 4GB DDR-4 RAM# Integrated Intel 620 Graphics# 14 inch HD Display with Resolution 1366*768.# 3-cell (41WHR) battery &amp; Windows 10 OS.Following is the my user Experience :BUILD-QUALITY :------------------------# It has good build quality compared to price.# The top surface has matte finish and has good grip.# Speakers has good output.# It weighs around 1.5 KG, which is moderate weight considering the size.# Finally it looks good.DISPLAY :------------# HD LED screen with a resolution of 1366*768 performs great.# Colours are Punchy.# Contrast is well above average.# Display performs well upto my expectations.KEYBOARD &amp; SPEAKERS :------------------------------------# Keyboard Doesn&#39;t have backlit.# Feedback from keyboard is good.# It Doesn&#39;t have a Numpad.# Placement pf speakers are good,# Has Enough sound output.# Performance is above average.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :--------------------------------------# Its average performing battery.# With full charge I used to clock above 3 hours of battery backup.# It charges under 3 hours.# Even with Medium Brightness and heavy Multitasking, I used to get above 2 hours of backup.# So overall battery backup is below average.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :------------------------------------# I had NO problems while using this laptop for surfing and browsing internet.# Small and medium games also runs smoothly on it.# It Doesn&#39;t have fingerprint scanner.# Has 1x USB 2 and 2x USB 3 ports which are handy combination.# So to conclude its Average laptop.VERDICT :-------------Its a good device if the price would have being around 25k. UPS of this device is 7th gen processor, decent Storage and HP brand reliability. But apart from that there&#39;s hardly anything to attract. It lacks fingerprint sensor, Backlit keyboard, decent battery backup, better graphics and better display resolution. If there&#39;s a deal and if its available around 25k then go for it, else invest few thousand more and go for better device. For 30k its Not worth buying.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Honest Review after using 3 months.I am Digital Marketer by profession and I need machine which can easily handle my heavy excel file and data work. I found this laptop good but still it is not at my level. If only accessing file, mails, PPT etc is concerned then it is the best laptop at this price range.I also have issue with the mouse pad, as the mouse which is coming up with this model is basic touchpad and not a multi touch pad.Rest everything is good.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/13\n&#39;,
 &#34;Best in looks, slim, light weight, display is awesome.....Performance as per specifications is good...It&#39;s a Beauty...Bought after so much research...Confused between Lenovo 330s and Dell latitude 14 inch series...It&#39;s much better than that....Would recommend this..\n&#34;,
 &#39;Overall pretty good package....pros:Light weight..Decent battery backup...Good looking smoke grey colour..Good build quality...Cons:Inbuilt battery non removableGlossy display( mat display is good here it is glossy so reflection is there)Display quality is not uptomarkSound quality is averageSystem is little laggy... Not that much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice product for this range.This lappy is really awesome if u buy around 26K. I bought it in 22990₹.Actual price was : 25990₹Instant discount applied from SBI card : 2000₹Received 1000₹ in Amazon Pay Balance : 1000₹Now Final price is 22990₹ (Great deal)\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop a month back during Amazon great indian festival. Been using it since then.The product is light weight, Sound is good, battery backup is good. But the important of all , the performance is horrible.I&#39;ve exchanged my 5 year old HP laptop with 3rd gen i5 processor. This has a  7th gen i3 processor &amp; still it&#39;s not even half good as my old one.The system lags , ALWAYS.Takes a lot of time to process any operations.I made a fresh install of windows 10 by created a recovery media &amp; it&#39;s a bit better than how it used to be.I realized this is a faulty product but i was late by that time. the last date for return has already completed 2 days before that. So now i&#39;m stuck with this super slow laptop, No where to go..and the worst thing.. RAM has only 1 slot with 4Gb, can&#39;t upgrade.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Please DO NOT buy UP product as I am stuck and wasted around 30K.System hangs every second and no support.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Purchased this Lappy for my Wife at the Amazon Sale for 23k after applying all discounts. I would say it is pretty good for the price. Looks sleek and slim, is light to carry around, screen display and sound is also good. Battery Life is pretty good at around 6+ Hrs. There is no fast charging though. As stated by others, performance is a slight issue. It is not fast or snappy and can take few seconds to launch apps. To get around it, i have added 4 GB Crucial 2400 RAM in Dual Channel and increased it to 8 GB. Though it is a challenge to remove the Back Cover to insert the RAM. HP has not made it end user friendly. Now, it responds better than before. Please do consider upgrading RAM to get around the slowness issue. Overall, it is a good laptop for doing basic tasks and light office work.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Overall it&#39;s a nice package provided if you get it under 28k or 29kSound quality is awesome , being a win10 os on 4gb ram lags sometime but that is manageable , looks good ,battery life is acceptable , a complete value for money buy given in this range .Competition is fierce in this range so choose according to your requirements mine was portability and in this area it aces given its dynamics and above all THANK U HP &amp; AMAZON\n&#34;,
 &#34;This laptop has 7th generation i3 processor with 4gb ram and 1tb HDD, still from the first usage only I found that this laptop is 20 times slower than my 5 year old Pentium Lenovo laptop.Once you make the payment your payments also gets strucked with Amazon and also the policy is not at all customer friendly, they will not initiate refunds so that you can buy a new and different model if u want, you will have to settle down with the same model. I will be getting that same model again today, hope my 31000/- bucks does not go in drain as Amazon has confirmed that the 2nd product but same model will be working great. They said they will ensure this. I hope I don&#39;t have to go through the same pain and agony again.\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s perfect for school and office use. Very cheap and beneficiao. Loved it in one go.very smooth and easy to use. Must buy\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good product meet my expectations\n&#39;,
 &#39;I got this one day before used it,loving it,no  lag,no stuck,genuinely HP.HP product and ordering on Amazon is deadly combination.Thank you Amajaan for delivering on time.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Unworthy product . Don&#39;t go with this.dont buy this one.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good laptop for this price, looks nice and performance not bad at all\n&#39;,
 &#39;Process slow sound system bad\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome Product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hanging problem\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s been using this laptop for 2 years. It&#39;s extremely heavy, with no battery life and I had to repair it so many times. Honestly, don&#39;t buy it.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Laptop seems good. Let&#39;s see how the performance is. Will update the review after usage. Not received any invoice.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Although, the laptop was delivered on time, but Beware!! the specs are not same as displayed.The HDD is actually of 5400 rpm (official Hp website) whereas Amazon displayed this of 7200 rpm!!We are charged for 7200 rpm but getting delivered 5400. This wasn&#39;t all expected.Still struggling for the actual laptop I paid for.\n&#34;,
 &#39;good laptop...display viweing angle is not so good!after buying this...i also buy m.2 ssd for it...by installing ssd on it and install os on ssd..this laptop is like flying so speed....\n&#39;,
 &#34;Researched a lot to get a laptop for almost 15 days and didn&#39;t want to buy those gigantic gaming lappys but still wanna game some. Came across this beauty as it was a notebook with great and power-packed specs. HP at it&#39;s back, it got a thumbs up from me.So using it for three days I have my impressions as below.Build Quality :- Absolutely excellent. Though it is made up of plastic, great finish and not prone to fingerprints.Display :- A FULL HD 1920×1080 panel makes it worth to consume media and other stuff. I loved the display but viewing angle are okaish.Battery :- This is where the device shines. With normal usage it is giving a usage time of 6-7 hrs or more but while gaming it&#39;s reduced to half due to the heavy NVIDIA GTX 1050 operations.Keyboard :- Much tactile and solid buttons with brilliant backlit coloured in green. Mouse Pad is average due to non-seperated buttons.Finally, it&#39;s a great and ideal deal for a student or other works. Recommended to buy.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Belive me this laptop is a true beast with gtx1050, it gives resonable fps on most AAA games. This laptop gives the best B&amp;O sound experience, sometimes it is even loud as jbl go, but all you need is perfect drivers for that and let the sound fly. The best thing is battery life, it once gave me 5 hrs with autoCAD, and 6 hrs of movie(vlc) time, but thats not it comes with some kind of boost chargin, which takes approx 50 mins to get fully charged from zero.Aesthetics are pretty neat. Acid Green color stands bold and beatiful not like those cheap red. Laptop body is another plus point, its clean and bold with a small touch hp logo it makes it elite.About basic features:It really has a nice keyboard one of its class I really it. Touch pad is the one that dissapoints me, its not that bad buut in this price range and features they should have worked a little bit for that.The port select is just normal. You get 3 usb 3.0 with hdmi, ethernet port, hdmi, headphine jack. They should have atleat given a usb type C(but the charger recovers that thing).Now most imortant thing for quality screen lover:This screen is not that good according to price range, but what more did you expect. If you are taking it PS or premiere pro.... Then go for some other options, this is just bcoz of screen. Although its not that bad but yeah its not for artists. And by the way its just 60hz.Here are some of my fps counter for some of my games:Just cause 4(max): 30fpsShadow of tomb raider(high):37-45CSGO(high): 120&#39;sCOD IW(HIGH): 55&#39;sMortal Comat X(max): 60Batman Arkam Knight(max):30Far cry 5(max): 35-50 it did touch 60 in medium settingsNFS payback(max):30And more maintained the legacy\n&#34;,
 &#34;I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn&#39;t work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space\n&#34;,
 &#34;i got a new laptop with damaged/faulty keyboard. I contacted to HP, but the service is worst. The HP didn&#39;t contact me for this issue even after 6 months of complaint.\n&#34;,
 &#34;After operating this laptop for about a week I started getting battery charging issues. Being a hardware issue, it was not visible during the technical troubleshooting and my ticket was closed. Due to the battery issues my HDD crashed eventually and had to force Amazon to make my replacement request happen. during that time I was told my complaint would stay open till my issue is resolved. The same issue started with the replacement model and Amazon told me that my replacement window has well lapsed and can&#39;t give me a refund. I was under the impression that the complaint window has been closed as soon as I got the refund which was not the thing which I was told. I have spent 64000 on this laptop and still have to go the service center even though Amazon has sold me bad products both times and it&#39;s well within my rights to request a refund for the laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I&#39;m complaining about the defective piece issue since 1st day of the delivery, but no action is taken yet. I haven&#39;t seen any return or replace order for this product on amazon app. The charger of the product stops charging everytime just after 15 minutes automatically while plug in and socket power is on. I have done all the troubleshoot action told by support team and updated all the drivers too! Please, understand my problem &amp; place return order for this product as early as possible, as lot of my work is pending just because of this issue.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The worst display ever. Wrong info on site, this laptop has no ips panel and color and contrast are evn worse than my 7k redmi phone. Pathetic\n&#39;,
 &#34;The spec says it all. It&#39;s fast, powerful and it&#39;s bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that&#39;s not too much to ask\n&#34;,
 &#39;The battery life was very very bad. In specification details, it is mentioned that the battery backup given upto 7 hours but it is coming only 3 hours. Very worst and very poor battery backup. So,  I want to return the product.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very disappointed with the product. It&#39;s been two days buying this product and on the very first day it&#39;s running too slow and even getting hanged when opening multiple tabs.Total waste of money. Don&#39;t buy this product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good performanceAverage battery backupMs office!! Not good for gaming !!⚠️⚠️hard drive crashes much likely 1 in a week.DONOT BUY IF YOU WANT PERFORMANCE.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is good , design,size, light weight. You should have provide backlit keyboard with it, with lifetime msoffice subscription\n&#39;,
 &#39;It Worth the prize I have bought. Its realy looks classic.  For students and offices work. This is not for gamers.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Expensive product as compared to the features given in the laptop.1. Average battery backup.2. Cheap plastic quality.3. Long Boot time.4. RAM performance is also not upto the mark.Overall, I am not happy with the product. Will not suggest to buy. Not an value for money product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Performance not as expected of a 8GB RAM i5 8th Gen laptop.Booting time very high .No pre installed anti virus , had to buy one from market .Sound and Display are average .By the way good performance for office work. Battery life average .\n&#39;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t look like a premium one and one thing which I don&#39;t like is material build quality is not that good. Keyboard could have been better. Display is also not that much good. All rest things are good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;A Value for money deal from HP. Great build quality. Win 10 out of the box. Ms office for 1month. Nice web cam. Smooth performance. Great battery backup 👍\n&#39;,
 &#39;i m faciingt too much battery Issue..not satisfied with this product\n&#39;,
 &#39;It handles everything with ease true value for money such a great specs at reasonable price i5 10th gen processor is very fast boot time only 5 seconds.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bought the laptop recently. It&#39;s a great product at its price with inbuilt MS office H&amp;S 2019. Average battery life is around 6-7 hours.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The laptop is a fantastic and the 256 GB SSD provides better booting speed than HDD. The features such as touch screen, pen, 360 degree folding gives great look for business purpose as well.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Extremely good...\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s fan makes lot of noise. That&#39;s very irritating. I am not sure what impact it will have on life of laptop. Get hot very fast.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is great to experience a Chromebook. This is faster than my Mac and Windows computers and very easy to use. Boots up quite fast. This should be good for most people for general use. This seems to be a well balanced Chromebook and is a good for its price. If someone wants a better quality screen, they can go for a higher end Chromebook. As a daily driver, this has become my first go to machine.  Good to see that finally HP is bringing Chromebooks to India at a reasonable price.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t buy this product. I received a faulty product. Its not turned on. I have charged this for 3 hrs but still its not working. I informed amazon call centre regarding this problem, but they are not ready to give replacement also.\n&#34;,
 &#39;overall a good experience of my first Chromebook\n&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;ve been using Chromebooks since they were launched and am completely invested into the Google ecology.The battery life is great, the screen is above average at this price point. Only quibble is the inability of the hinge to enable using it as a tablet. The sound from the speakers is just terrible too. The keyboard and touch screen are both quite responsive. It&#39;s a great road warrior - cheap and easy to lug around. If it lasts more than 2 years, that&#39;s just great.\n&#34;,
 &#34;For my everyday purposes of browsing, shopping and social media, this Chromebook is perfect!! I never needed Windows and when I read about the Chromebook, I was hopeful that it is just what I needed...and it is! I&#39;m happy with the screen/display, with the sound...everything! And it&#39;s fast too :) If you don&#39;t need all the extra bells and whistles that comes with Windows, then you will love the simplicity of the Chromebook.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very worst only for browsing if u want to purchase this you should go with mobile means mobile is better than chromebook\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome\n&#39;,
 &#39;A decent Chromebook by HP. White color looks awesome. My very first Chromebook and I am in love with it. Faster and secure than windows. Good for everyday tasks. No lag boosts faster.\n&#39;,
 &#34;This device has got great battery life plus is extremely lightweight. perfect is you&#39;re not a heavy software user .Great for students who are not into gaming and stuff\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great product. Only there is no backlight key board as stated\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hi, I have been using  HP 14Q CS0009TU laptop for a month now.Pros:1.5 Kg laptop - light in weight than any other brand in this price segment.Value for money - I purchased for Rs 24999/- (Dos OS) ; Windows OS model is around 29kCompact in size - The 14-inch screen is quite convenient to operate and carryMouse pad and keyboard is quite good. Suitable for rough use. The webcam is not of great quality but it fulfills its purpose.Battery life is pretty decent, it\&#39;s last long for 5.5 hours. My usage is: I carry it to the office by train and work for 9 hours daily(suggested to work in Airconditioned environment for long hours usage).I have loaded Opensource Ubuntu (version -18.04)  as you can see in the images.Quick Charger -  It takes 45 min to charge the battery to 100 %, pretty fast.Speaker is of Average music quality, loudness is decent  (use good quality earphones to listen to nice music)4GB RAM is PerfectI am not a Gammer - I hope Intel Core i3 7th Gen processor with 4 GB ram is sufficient to fulfill your basic needs.Movie watching experience is decent. Anti-glare screen is good.Cons: The only drawback I have noticed is, Delay in Bootup time. It takes almost 45sec+ to load the home page (i am not sure about the Windows OS). I don\&#39;t complain about it, I plug the laptop charger in the socket and clean my Workplace in mean load time..HA ha haa..&#34; compromise&#34;Overall I am so happy about choosing this product. I call it  &#34;Value for Money&#34; Laptop\n&#39;,
 &#34;It lags a bit but it should do fine for office or college useNot for intense coding or gamingIt&#39;s only 14 inch with in built battery n no disk driver but its very very light\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is not useful to me as it is not supporting to Windows 7. As mentioned in features and details that &#34;This is DOS based laptop out of the box. You will need to install your own operating system ( such as Windows ) separately.&#34;According to above features, I have purchased this laptop but now not useful to me.\n&#39;,
 &#39;We bought dos version to use with Linux. First issue we faced was, WiFi not working. We contacted HP support, we got a reply  that they do not have expertise in Linux! and cant support. With some online help we could get it working but intermittently and with very low wifi strength. We started using it with LAN and after couple of weeks laptop stopped booting.With no HP support near by and easily available it lying useless now.\n&#39;,
 &#34;After using 13 days, I am trying to express my views on this laptop. As I am an orthodox Linux user, I didn&#39;t find any difficulty to load a linux OS of my choice. WiFi has to be configured manually. Booting time is a bit longer. But once it boots there is no problem about the processor speed. Best deal within 25K. For those who are disappointed for not having windows 10 with is laptop, please see the specs first and then buy. It is clearly mentioned that it comes with only Free DOS. So, obviously one has to install a favorable OS in it separately. For that, one has to have the knowledge of installing an OS in a computer. AND a trick to run windows 7 and 8 is:Install a Linux OS, install Oracle virtualbox and then install windows 7, 8, or 10. It will work 100% without any problem with drivers. But windows 10 is a bit slower than windows 7 on virtualbox.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Guys best choice for this price, but try to buy on this on some offer&#39;s, it will save ur money. Purchase DOS , it will save ur money around 5k. It has been a month , battery is awesome. Lap is not for gaming but still u can play some games because it is packed with i3 processor... I purchased it for 26k\n&#34;,
 &#39;First determine what type of a user you are.If you are gamer, then this laptop is not for you.If you are a heavy duty user, then this laptop is not for you.If your are a multi-tasker, then again this laptop is not for you.This laptop is for those who- want light use (i3, that too 7th gen)- some office work (4GB ram, without high end graphics)- traveller (lightweight, no CD drive, plastic body)- home use to keep data (1TB drive)Speed - 3/5Storage - 5/5Design - Sleek - 5/5Keyboard 5/5If you have the windows software that you can migrate to this, use that. Else, take the windows 10 home configuration.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It\&#39;s been two weeks after the date of purchase. I\&#39;ve been using Windows 8.1 in my old laptop as I found it the simplest and fastest OS I\&#39;ve ever used with a 4GB Ram variant. I feel Both Windows 7 and Windows 10 a little heavier when compared to Windows 8.1. Even though I installed Win 8.1 in this model, I was unable to find suitable drivers as it is not available in HP Support and other blogs too. Then only I found a leaflet of my lap docs in which its written &#34; Your product does not support Windows 7 and 8. And Finally, I had to install Windows 10 which I was skeptical. But after installing Win 10, I got the drivers automatically when I connected the internet. Everything works fine except the Booting Time. I feel so sluggish while booting as its taking a couple of mins to boot up. The rest of the things like Battery and Usability are good. I dunno why its slow in booting while other things work well.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I am just using the product for few days and I am just impressed. It\&#39;s light waight and very fast. there is very little heating runs smoothly. This comes with DOS verson. So i have installed Windows 10 in it and windows 10 is the best thing I have seen. it\&#39;s smooth and very easy to use. You can use it free and also can upgrade it, but there is no problem using it free. You will get every updates and most of the functins. You also can buy windows 10 product key in nearly 600-1500 rupees from flipkart. I have ordered one and waiting for it.just one thing this pc support only Windows 10 . It will not support windows 7,8 etc. Also ypu need to downloads drivers from their website and install them separately.this pc is very light weight and best for reading books. You can play many games . I am recently playing &#34;Company Of Heroes &#34; game , which is running just fine. i think it will handle games before 2015-16 prity well though it is not a gamming laptop.just go for it . Don\&#39;t think much about installing windows 10. See some YOUTUBE videos and you will do it fine.Overall light weight,Fast and allrounder laptop. Go for it. Thanks.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a horroble product! Please do not get cheated by buying this. It is so slow that tou can press the start button and go make tea while the system gets ready. No kidding, ot clocked 90 seconds just to open ms word. And it keeps hanging. Amazon should stop selling this!\n&#39;,
 &#39;I received this laptop this morning after I ordered it yesterday in a lightening deal with a 6 month interest free EMI. I have been a user of the Macbook Air for the last 3 years and was hesitant to buy a windows laptop having gotten used to the Mac at home. But the price differential of almost 23K between this and the Macbook Air + MS Office as well as the fact that on Apple Mac I cannot save XML files easily, additional purchase of MS office, no flash player, etc. forced me to purchase this laptop yesterday. I am very impressed with it so far. Set up was easy and smooth. The Laptop has a matt finish that feels great to look and feel. It feels as light as my Macbook Air. The display is superb. The keyboard is soft to use and accurate. Boot time is a few seconds and a little slower than the Mac where it is instantaneous but that is hardly a negative here. Some people have asked if MS office comes pre-installed and the answer is YES. I just had to accept the license agreement and that was it. It also comes with a trial period of MacAfee antivirus for a month. Satisfied in every way with this purchase. Hope it is as reliable and virus free in the months and years to come as my Macbook Air. I think the 8GB Ram and the 256GB SSD combination helps in the weight and boot time for this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Amazing combination THAT&#39;S VERY, very rare to find in any brand.Pros:1.) 8th gen i5 is futureproof (there was a more than usual jump in performance bw 7th and 8th gen, so DON&#39;T go for any of the 7th gen processors!!!)2.) SSD is blazing fast, 3-5 seconds is the boot time. 256 GB is sufficient these days, given most of our stuff stays in cloud.3.) 1080p screen is crisp and sufficiently bright4.) Build quality of laptop is above avg, but looks are very good.5.) Light weight, 14 inch form factor allows massive protability.6.) Surprisingly good battery life! The battery life is way above avg but it&#39;s actually the super low charging time which impressed me.Cons:1.) No dedicated graphics2.) Build quality and feel could have been better. The finish looks good, but attracts smudges a lot.But these cons won&#39;t really matter to folks like me who just code and don&#39;t play games.If you wanna need a powerhouse in a 14 inch 1080p screen with SSD, this one will ace the job!!!\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is quiet Good Handy laptop with i5 it says it weighs 2.04 kg but it is light weight as a bookAnd also performance is better. The screen is FHDit has1.80 GHZ clock speed No Pen or Touch, 64 bit processor 8gb DDR4 and comes 247 gb of storageIt comes with pre-installed windows 10 home and Microsoft office all apps bulit-in free with the laptopIt is very black I mean if you put your hands on top surface for long time it can detect your fingerprint marks and also of more pressure sweat marks evenIt just boots in 3-4 seconds of time It is great boot up because it has ssd rather than old hdd\n&#39;,
 &#34;The is a pretty good laptop for those who don&#39;t have heavy use like gaming or etc. Its  Smooth working ,Voice and camrera quality is also satisfactory . The laptop design could have been better . It leaves smudge marks of fingers on the back . Otherwise it&#39;s a COOL laptop\n&#34;,
 &#39;Other than the build quality, everything else is great. Original Windows 10 (Home) &amp; MS Office 2019 (Home). i5, ssd &amp; 8GB Ram ensures no lag in productivity. Even 10 active tabs on chrome will not slow down the machine. Also very light. 👍👍\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great product with great price and home delivery.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Charger pin or cable /socket inside laptop is not proper, So it stops charging sometime !Advice what to do\n&#39;,
 &#39;Since this laptop is ssd version it is very fast and realible\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awsm laptop. Nice look and very fast.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t buy dell product I have bought i5 8th generation laptop on 12 April 19. since then I have done many customer complaints and replaced many parts still it&#39;s slow, takes hell lot of time to start, screen flickers and USB and headphone portal doesn&#39;t work.This piece of crap Laptop cost me Rs. 56,015 and You know the best part of this, Dell will never ever going to replace it, they will ask you to replace certain parts all the time. Every 15 days I m in customer service center to replace the part. Photo will shows you current situation of 4 month or Laptop. DONT EVER BUY DELL PRODUCT THEY DON&#39;T THINK ABOUT CUSTOMER. I have recently lodged new customer complaint for replacement (as you can see the situation of my laptop) then I will retract my words until then please I would advise you not to use this Dell products. Each purchase from you will give the power to bully honest customers like me.FYI One start is compulsion Not my rating\n&#34;,
 &#39;Received my HP laptop yesterday. Its intel i5 and cost me 46,990 rupees.Literally shocked to see the quality of the laptop and it looks like its a duplicate one.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic and they said they are not responsible for the quality and cannot do anything.Learnt my lesson  and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in  future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.I will stick to Flipkart for any high value items in future.Will update the photos of the product I received shortly. Mostly I am going to throw it away.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Honest review after 5 days of usage.If you have to write a lot but it doesn\&#39;t requires a numpad (if you\&#39;re not an accountant/involved with number) then, having a properly centered keyboard with a 14&#34; screen is ideal if you have to often carry your laptop around (maybe at school or college)I have bought the i5 + 8 GB RAM with Office 2019 versionPros:1. Crisp keys. Great typing experience.2. It came with pre-installed office 2019 and windows 10 home.3. Pretty good battery. The battery optimization scroll function which lets you balance battery life and performance is very helpful.4. Great touchpad with multiple gesture functions, some of which are like Macbook\&#39;s. You can switch between apps using 3 finger swipes. You can go back to desktop from anywhere with downwards 3 finger swipe. You can go to tabs view with upwards 3 finger swipe. You can open notification panel with 4 finger tap. You can even enable horizontal and vertical scroll for the touchpad. It will work on the touchpad borders once you turn it on. The touchpad settings software is a must to customize and makes working much faster.5. Dark mode is great and works universally.6. Light weight and can easily be carried around using a single hand.7. Additional slot for SSD expansion. You can make it hybrid storage.8. Great color and screen contrast.9. Almost every element of the system is highly customizable and that\&#39;s great.Cons :1. It is already thin, but with its weight and size, it could be thinner.2. You cannot change your username under C:/users if you while logging in for the first time logged in with Microsoft account. If you do that, Microsoft will take the first 5 letters of your email and make it your permanent username. You won\&#39;t be able to change that.I\&#39;d suggest initially logging in without logging into anything and just skip the option. That way you can change your own username. I had reset the whole computer because it was annoying. I don\&#39;t know why Microsoft can\&#39;t fix something so small.3. No anti-glare screen. If a light reflection is there you just gotta increase the brightness 🤷🏼\u200d♂️4. The bezels could\&#39;ve been thinner.5. Doesn\&#39;t comes with a bag.It\&#39;s not the laptop that sucks in any way. It\&#39;s Microsoft windows, the most mainstream OS of the world that sucks. Windows 10 certainly has a much larger scope of customization compared to previous windows.This laptop is built more for professional usage but you can easily run mid tier games. However if you\&#39;re looking more towards gaming and less towards MS office, you can get a laptop in SAME PRICE RANGE with nvidia graphics but then you probably won\&#39;t get office.Overall, the pros overweigh the cons. This is probably the best 14&#34; laptop between 40-50k. If your budget is near 50k, put 2 thousand more and buy that HP 14 with the same features + 256 GB SSD and silver colour. BUT if your budget is less than that, You probably won\&#39;t find a better option with office 2019 lifetime validity.Must buy if you\&#39;re involved in typing a lot of professional stuff since it has pretty well laid out keyboard with preloaded office.Do like if you found this useful.Feel free to ask any questions!!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Screen doesn&#39;t works.. The quality is not good. It is the worst product i had ever bought. Totally disappointed with this product. Please refund this. Display doesn&#39;t works. Bad name for HP company\n&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t even think of buying this product. I bought it on EMI, 39990 rs. It&#39;s very slow.. It takes 10 minutes to start. I am trying to return it since last fifteen days, and get my money back. So, that I can buy another one. But every day the coustmer executive says it will be done within two days for sure but I don&#39;t know what is wrong with amazon it could not done even after fifteen days. They are getting interest from this money and deliberately trying to postpone it. I could have given - 🌟 if was possible. Battery life is OK. To buy it is total waste of money, time and energy. Only good thing about this product is that it is light weight and looks good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;i am surprise that in the discription screen it was written with MS officei was disappointed when i saw its a 30 days trial software ...now my daughter is in a fix tht wht will happen after 30 we have buy  MS office seprately ...totally disappointed by Amazon for the first time in life..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent product in this price range. No complaints since 1 month if usage\n&#39;,
 &#39;Totally 😥. Ordered 8GB RAM, 1TB hard drive, 14 inch hp, Windows 10, i5...ButGot14 inch, Dual core AMD processor,256 GB hDD, 4GB RAM.DisappointedPls replace with original... Item..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Waste product\n&#39;,
 &#39;corrupt display driver sent\n&#39;,
 &#34;Probably one of the best around the specified price rangeI would recommend to go for it.But, there&#39;s no office with lifetime validity.You&#39;ll have to install a crack from the internet or share someone&#39;s Microsoft account for accessing the complete features of the office 365 and it&#39;s applications.Battery is amazingAudio is also greatAll in all, if you are looking for a good laptop for work and a little bit of gaming, then this one is worth buying\n&#34;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t go with their i3 version as its damn slow to work instead choose this one and it works really better. I use for development purpose apart from doing simple daily work and it never lags when it comes to performance. The build quality is better than Dell / Lenovo that are in this price range.\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is best for work and almost small games can easyly be played on this i play pubg mobile its working great without gpu too BUT I SUGGEST EVERYONE TO GET IT FROM OFFLINE STORE YOU WILL GET MANY ACCESSORIES WITH IT ALSO YOU CAN CLAIM ANY DAMAGE EASYLY..... THANK YOU HP FOR THIA WONDERFUL LAOTOP...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall good except battery remain for 4 to 4.5 hours..\n&#39;,
 &#39;No backlit Keyboard, its confusing. Really is there or not?\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have not used it pretty much but until now it looks good..... It&#39;s a budget laptop with such a beautiful design. Performance wise I have not installed any heavy softwares so I am not very sure of it. Until now it looks good. Just it&#39;s a bit heavy from what I had assumed.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Well what to say. Received on 9 th aug used for approx 13 days maybe about 2 hrs a day and today the screen goes blank  No display totally blank. Took half hour to get HP to register a complaint and they will Take 2 to 3 working days for a site visit. A brand new laptop with this problem!!!!  Lets see the after sales service of HP\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product,Performance is good for both programming and daily usage,Awesome battery backup.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product that i have received is defective, the windows keeps crashing constantly and the screen goes blank with small square lines appearing on the screen. This has a 5th Gen i5 processor and should be capable of performaing tasks withing seconds but this product is so slow that it makes me question whether this was a new piece provided to me by amazon or not. The constant hanging of apps and the screen going black and the display showing all sorts of messages that functions cannot be performed has left me to conclude that amazon has delivered a defective product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is great laptop worth its price. Its colour is very sexy and looks very good. Magnificent features are there I reccomend u to buy this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;It a wonderful laptop from hp\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product not working this is hang issue\n&#39;,
 &#39;The touchscreen at 33k was a good deal at this pricepoint. Just started using so can say that it comes with a lot of useful preloaded features like MS office,anti virus etc...speed a bit slow but manageable...all in all good value for money for someone looking for low to moderate home usage .\n&#39;,
 &#39;Gud responsive touch. Nice premier look. Brought it in prime day sale. Battery backup yet to be checked, working fine good for day to day tasking.Webcam not so gud but ok in this price. Touch screen working good,Overall nice product from HP.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Performance of the laptop is very bad...it always hangs\n&#39;,
 &#39;Display quality is worst, and keyboard button is not well maintained, looks like a cheap product. Bezel around of display is loose like a local picked items. I am confirmed I got a duplicate HP product. And I wish this must be replace with a good. But I have not got any msgs from amazon India yet. So never go with this.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worst\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a good laptop for new learners. Everything is fine except the slowness. Since I bought this for my kids, I have no complains. But if you are thinking to use it and you are fast, avoid this. Even after updating the system, finetuning the applications this still behaves slow. Its been nearly one month for me now. Touch screen works perfectly fine. This is a very good laptop for reader, new learners, school students.\n&#39;,
 &#34;The product is hopelessly slow .. I had purchased it for simply office work .. preparing word docs etc. It takes forever to start and has very slow in responses . I fail to understand why is it even in existence. My 7-8 years old desktop and laptop are more efficient than this laptop. Not worth it. Won&#39;t recommend.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Battery drains very fast. Even in sleep mode power is used up. This is disappointing.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good product from HP. Touch screen is good.Sny touch screen laptop from other brand is in 40000 to 50000 range.Nice product and speed and display overall 4.5 rate out of 5.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a quality laptop at this price. Reviewing after 7 regular days of use. It does not lag, works properly and I prefer DOS, so that I can install programs of my choice and that do not hang.I got a grey one... Authentic seller.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Performance is very good\n&#39;,
 &#34;everything is good I think it&#39;s best laptop i3 7th gen with good quality sound and best battery if you have more Money 30000+ than bay i3 8th otherwise this are the best in upgrade version support\n&#34;,
 &#39;over all good lap top on this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Cooling fan not working\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not received laptop bag, Software CD and Manual.\n&#39;,
 &#39;like this product very much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop bag not available\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product defect at the time of purchase itself, I filed a complaint through Amazon but no response and my laptop is not working still, no service center near also, I filed a complaint within two days itself\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is really awesome😍😍.But,packageing is not so good.There was no airbag in the packet.. I got no bill with the package.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Purchased it from the local Hp world with the gaming bag free worth 4k. I bought it for 1.15k and its worth the price with gtx 1660 ti. Very fast boot up and very smooth rendering..and good for high end games..really love the model.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Okay I have been using it for almost two months now. General Performance wise I have no complaints. Boots up in seconds and is super fast for day to day tasks like web browsing, Video streaming, emails etc.I use it for music production with FL Studio and various third party plugins and no matter how heavy the project is, there are absolutely no complaints.Now for the gaming part, 90% of the games I played in it there were no issues in High/Ultra settings and 1080p (The latest CODs, Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1 etc). PUBG will stutter at highest settings so I recommend 720p with medium settings for a lag free performance.I would recommend a cooling pad while using the laptop for gaming as it gets pretty hot and thermal throttling could be an issue here if you are not using it on adequate surfaces (for example if you like playing on your bed). I use an external monitor and gaming set while at home so it’s easy to just dock it to a cooling pad. If you are playing directly on the laptop using the laptop keyboard, Play around with pad adjustments until you find a position that is ergonomically suitable for you.Battery life is average at best during gaming. I could play just about 2 full rounds of CODBO4 in the highest settings at 1080p and 3.5 rounds of PUBG in Medium settings at 720p before the low battery mode kicked in at 20%. Though to be honest I never use my laptops on battery while heavy usage and always carry my adapter around wherever I go.On the other hand, battery backup was pretty decent while streaming videos or other day to day tasks. You can easily watch 2 full movies at 80% brightness and still have some juice left before it reaches 20%.All in all, this is a good machine at a really good price, especially for Intermediate gamers like me. If you are a Pro gamer, then HP Omen series are what you should be looking at instead of this.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is well nice and all. But the bagpack was not sent with the product. The official HP website says that the bagpack is included but none received.\n&#39;,
 &#39;\xa0This Laptop is just Ultimate.I bought this one from Local store in 73000 Including HP Gaming Backpack.This Laptop is Best for medium Budget Gamers.Looks and Feels Premium..Performance is Just Amazing and QuickBoot up Time is 4sSound quality is Good And Loud, Lacking bass\n&#39;,
 &#34;The product&#39;s design, appearance, and performance are really good and worth the price. But the in-build programs such as the Anti-virus and MS-Office that comes along has trial subscription only.  Such a price should always come with a good subscription of at least the most basic programs.Thank you.\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s aweome\n&#34;,
 &#39;Ultimate for gaming. speed is best\n&#39;,
 &#34;My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn&#39;t matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is the first day of my leptop and i transfer files from my pen drive to leptop almost 39 GB  when files transfer in background and i play some videos the system hang up.. everything stop ...i power off leptop after 1 hr and again start then it start running smoother.... i dont know why this happen...can it happen in future also?Expect this one time issue this lap top runs very good\n&#39;,
 &#39;First time have received one defective product (one USB port was not working) , after great assistance and service from amazon ,got the replacement.New product is totally in good working state and no defect in hardware section.Thanks to amazon for your great commitment.Product Review:-Laptop performance is totally satisfactory.Someone thinks that 4 gb ram is not enough but i will suggest if you are purchasing for daily use and littlebit of programming then this laptop value for money.Under 40k this is worthy laptop.No lagging,no heating till now after 1 week of using.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s good product and delivery at expected time, highly recommend who are willing to buy SSD at lowest price\n&#34;,
 &#34;Since it&#39;s provide SSD with 4Gb ram I think it is value for money.. boot up speed is amazing. Screen resolution good since I get MS office and license Windows version so it is best what I min. want in my laptop..\n&#34;,
 &#39;Although the specifications are rich, performance is poor. Hanging issues are as usual. Performance wise disappointed.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best of best under 41k. hdd,ssd, w10,ms office, integrated graphics all R best u need only additional ram.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good one..at this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;\xa0Product was good but i got defect piece with screen issue. Please check ur screen when product is delivered\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;Well after going through all the websites  &amp; reviews finally decided on this one. It doesn&#39;t have dvd writer but very slim &amp; light weight.It also offers anti glare screen.8 GB ram works like butter.Go for it.Around 31 k paid under sale. Unfortunately I bought through GRAB A GADGET &amp; found they replaced the original charger with cheap one. I request all of you just go to the company store and buy genuine goods instead of saving 1000/500 Rs.  Although machine is good but my entire happiness has gone.\n&#34;,
 &#39;In images there is disc drive but in originalProduct there is not a disc drive....!!\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good laptop, lightweight as it does not include optical disk drive,includes windows 10 &amp; microsoft office home with life time warranty. Read a lot reviews about the laptop being slow and initially did face the problem. The problem did get solved by stopping most of the unessential apps/programs running in the background also uninstalled McAfee antivirus software and installed Kaspersky total security and that greatly helped in improving the booting and overall activity speed. I have no issues now wrt speed. Good for routine work, not suitable for gaming. Suits my type of routine work satisfied. Deserves a 4 star but given it a 5 star as I got it at a generous price and exchange  offer during Great Indian festival Sale.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Initially when we get this laptop. If u can send one service engineer at free cost, to demo the laptop, it will be better. We could not get the doubts clarified.But, if we buy from store, we get service support from service engineer. This facility is missing, buying through oniine. May be, we get price difference buying through online. But, demo by expert makes lot of difference.\n&#39;,
 &#34;it doesn&#39;t have cd/dvd writer... in image there is a dvd writer... in specifications also.. but in real it doesn&#39;t have.. I purchased it and really disappointed... amazon is lier in this case...\n&#34;,
 &#34;As per picture this model comes with DVD Writer but, actually its not. Don&#39;t mislead your customers.  Otherwise everything is good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Product is upto the mark but adapter is not original\n&#39;,
 &#39;Dvd writer is not available on this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;CD/DVD Writer is not given,but is showing on picture. RJ- 45 Port is not there.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It’s an awesome laptop, light weight, sleek design, with just right configuration for home and light use. Bought it for my wife and she is happy with it. Cones with 4gb ram, 1TB hard disk and windows 10 loaded.The speed is ok not that slow, happy with performance.  Realiable HP product.Seller is awesome. Package comes with an OTP for safe delivery.Bought it with exchange for 21 K.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this laptop as it doesn&#39;t support 5GHz wifi band which is common in airtel and jio giga fibre for better speed (like 100 Mbps) . Now i have to live with 2.4 GHz WiFi band speed only. Pathetic description and Amazon is equally resposbile for this fault. My 10 years old laptop Compaq 510 support 5 GHz band while this year 2019 HP model doesn&#39;t support what a irony for all HP user.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good and functional for light use. I found the power button too small and usb slots too tight. Otherwise no complaints.\n&#39;,
 &#39;the processor is very slow when ever i use internet its just show loading loading.....nd process of copping file through other devices is also very slow. It eventually shows white screen. nd all this thing is happening from 1st day. Dont buy this product . Complete waste of money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfect laptop for business  users 14 inch screen with mat finish in low price all the spec is good having a msata name slot for SSD\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Satisfied with the product especially with battery backup.Initially some lag is there, now it works fine. Only thing is need to shutdown properly instead of hard shutdown.\n&#39;,
 &#34;At 1st I don&#39;t want to compare it with other productsUnder 24k it&#39;s good and never ever buy from Amazon bcz the delivery system of Amazon is so pathetic.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Slow performance observedNot supporting 5ghz network.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfect but require update and licence key for other apps\n&#39;,
 &#39;highly disappointed by Amazon services.. I purchased this laptop on 29-09-2019 and it is delivered by 04-10-2019..on purchase i come to see, the product has 1 year warranty.. but when i registered my product with HP care, it is showing end date of warranty is 26-05-2020, that is only 7 months.. Amazon has really cheated me.. please find the images attached..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Keyboard not working ..and hanging problem so much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall good product\n&#39;,
 &#34;Did not received the bag for laptop ND os CD..... That&#39;s why I am giving 3 stars.  Laptop wise it&#39;s good.... ND easy to carry.\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is Fake why ? Because so in Image this laptop have Fingerprint so but does  not come with fingerprint .\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fantastic product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Display is blinking every second. Unable to operate &amp; use. Please guide what to do?\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good item\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have opted this for its battery life claims and light weight touch screen. But battery life is maximum 3-4 hrs even for slight to moderate usage. Looking good and lightweight. It is lagging bit with multi tasks. I have added another Samsung 8GB ram. Now it is working smoothly..Minimum 8GB requires for better performance. This is not for gaming .\n&#39;,
 &#39;I received the product in time.  The display is okay.  It has the latest 1903 update installed.  It comes with a 265gb of ssd hdd space.  Free scapce 206 gb.  SSD will give you good boot time and multi tasking pros but this is not for one who is loking to save music, movies and all thise stufs. It has a sd slot which could be used to increase memory.  MS office work great.  The KB  has backlit.FHD screen, MS office,  256SSD, BL keyboard are the key features.  Good buy for 47990 . Price might decrease 1k in flash sales but not more I guess.\n&#39;,
 &#39;wonderful product ...it takes care of all basic needs like WORD PPT EXCEL etc. .drawing , highlighting important items in text , adding finer details into various items in PPT s , hand writing notes lot many things can be done .. seems like battery drains fast initially but it is acceptable..no issues with touch screen it is smooth ...screen is Full HD ..slim bezels ...key board is backlit ..typing experience is like pressing into smooth rubber , enjoyed typing ..there is some play in the screen hinges may need some support like thick book at the back, it is difficult to concentrate and type on the screen while on move sitting in a car , due  to screen wobbling ...the experience is smooth while changing from one app to another  but not very fast especially videos .. may be due to 4 GB RAM ..the speakers have very good sound reproduction...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall erformance is good the only issue is that 4.30 hr battery back up\n&#39;,
 &#39;HP has improved the quality and finish to make this convertible comparable to MacBook Air though it is heavier . The battery charges quickly but does not last for full 10 hours .The Full HD display is good and touchpad has gestures. There is slight wavery screen flicker when you scroll fast and hence is not smooth to watch.Other than this the Keys are smooth to use and battery charge has indicator on laptop side. The power button also has been moved to the side.Overall with MS Office Home version ,Inkpen and Windows 10 included  this is a quality product from HP\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#34;The product is useless. The support just refers to service center for simple queries like what is max ram supported? Lenovo and other have everything on site. Nothing called product manual. The article onsite that shows opening is incorrect or outdated(no screws in place). HP is worst when it comes to customer orientation and their products suck.I&#39;ll never buy anything from HP even if they give it for free.Product doesnt support some apps due to screen setting of HP. Worst money waste. You can buy DELL or apple that actually works\n&#34;,
 &#34;Pros-Quality screen and light weight. 2 in 1 laptop, Included ms office. Cons- noisy fan, clumsy backspace button, loose touch pad, worst battery life. HP customer care is worst and doesn&#39;t know that this model exists. HP website says no driver available for this product. If you can live with these you can buy otherwise a big no. Replacement item also had all these issues in addition to a new issue of product been registered 2 months back and only 10 months warranty. Terrible experience\n&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent product for the price . Could have included some protector case as it has 360 fold . Though can be upgraded from 4gb ram to 12 gb ram within 15 mins or less.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Let&#39;s break this review into 5 parts:1.Overall look2.Performance3.Software experience4.Battery life5.Other features1.Overall lookFirst of all lookwise the laptop looks very very premium.The build quality is certainly very good on this and the best part of the build quality is that it does not flex at all.The top seems to be made up of some magnesium or aluminium alloy, the keyboard layout and surrounding material.also seesm to be of aluminium .The bottom section is of high quality plastic based.The power button on the side glows when you are using the laptops and seems to be cool.Overall the laptop very finely built.2.PerformanceNow speaking of the performance I must say I am impressed here.Dont judge this laptop by its processor.even though it has core i3-8145U 8th generation processor but this processor has turbo boost a feature that had never been seen before in any i3 processor.It has a base frequency of 2.1Ghz and during turbo boost it can clocked upto 3.9Ghz and believe me guys it just blazing fast.Laptop seems very snappier.It has a Samsung 2433 MHz RAM and it is really fast.Now the most important thing about any laptop is the kind of storage used in it.Here we have SSD.let me clear this , the SSD used here isnot SATA based , it is a m.2 PCIe based NVME SSD Toshiba SSD and I think this is the main contributing factor for this laptop performance.Since it is using a SSD perfoance is very good plus booting time is hardly 7-8 seconds.The keyboard has a nice feeling to it while typing and it has backlit.The bang and Olufsen speaker are also very crisp and clear and descently loud.Since this laptop has SSD,I am.happy to say it has no heating issues.The screen is full HD IPS LCD display and it is very ubrant in Colors.The brightness is good and it is sharp Plus it is touchscreen.HP seems to include fast charging here as the laptop charges 64 percent in 50 minutes which is very good.Now speaking about battery life,battery life is descent with 6-10hours of battery life.After I started using this laptop, I received a BIOS update and after that the battery backup seems to be good . I got 7.00 hrs of battery backup with this laptop.In context of I/O port it has two usb 3.1 ports which is rare in this price segment , a type c port and an HDMI port,alongwith headphone jack(oh my god!).3.Software ExperienceThe laptop is powered by windows 10 May 2019 update (1903) and since it&#39;s windows 10 you will get software updates and future windows version along the road.It came with a full version of 2019 which needs to be activated I activated the same without having any issues.4.Battery lifeBattery included in 41 Watts and can lasts upto 6-10 hours of battery life.5.Other featuresThe trackpad included here is windows precision trackpad.The included HP pen is really very cool and has very very low latency.Also.the laptop is 360 degrees rotatable and hence can be used it tent mode,360 mode and tablet mode also.Final verdict the laptop is very good.Hp has certainly improved their quality of product.The only concern is the 256 GB of storage I suggest to purchase an external.hard drive if not you can upgrade the m.2 SSD also.Just don&#39;t believe on anything negative regrading the laptops.Only processor will not make a laptop gudIt&#39;s the whole package that integrates with the laptop make it a good one.If u want a lightweight and powerful laptop go with this one One important thing to note is if you purchased another variant of this laptop with 720p HD screen then it don&#39;t have a backlit keyboard and display is certainly less sharper than 1080p one.Delivery feedback:Last thing i want it share is the pathetic Amazon delivery service.The laptop shipped in time and also reached my city.But the delivery agent  don&#39;t what wrong with him made it out for delivery at 9pm and after repeatedly calling him haven&#39;t received the call and around 1.00 am in night started blank calling him.The next day it came to me that the laptop was not returned back to couriers but in the possession of the agent for whole day.I had to escalate the matter at the higher level and after continue following up the next whole day they deliver my laptop.A word of advice from me, if you are writing this laptop for this price in the local ho.store then please purchase from it as Amazon has no control over their delivery agents.And Amazon please do consider this feedback seriously as agents are not allowed to call after 9.00pm certainly not at 1.00AM in the morning I guess!\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good performance,Full display, but missing backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner\n&#39;,
 &#34;see its i3 processor with 4 gb ram so gamers should be away from it.but its worth buying. ssd h to superfast boot time and superfast transfer speed.speeker is not that good just average.screen quality is average colur changes at different howerver from 90° its gudtouch response is goodyou can use it as teblet too thats another advantage.overall if you r not a gamer , go for italso its best choice for artist to make morden art.note i haven&#39;t tried playing any game in this.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Got the  product is should be having a backlit keypad and finger print sensor it doesn&#39;t have either over all the product is awesome guy looking for a touch screen bugget laptop do go for this one!!!\n&#34;,
 &#34;bought this product 2 days back, unfortunately the laptop stopped working all of sudden, than i asked amazon to replace it.  within 2 days i got the fresh piece.about the product, i would say it looks awesome on your table, well built, quality is good, the only issue which i see is the quality of screen, i don&#39;t get the feel of HD even watching video at 1080P.\n&#34;,
 &#39;No backlit keyboar!\n&#39;,
 &#39;No backlit keyboard or fingerprint scanner. Misleading. Not even able to return due to missing features. No customer support.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just recieved it today and i cannot believe that HP has made such a lighweight and beautiful 2 in 1 Laptop / tablet..Windows 10 is a breeze and easy to use..Such a nice laptop at such a cost effective price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Back-lit key board and finger print scanner claimed are missing. Callousness specifications to attract the prey.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I love this...Working so fast... Delivery of product was slow... But product is awesome...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great product\n&#39;,
 &#34;The best option for this price range. The specs are fabulous. Don&#39;t buy this from Amazon as they are selling it for 87k which is way more than the HP showrooom price which is 83k. I bought this laptop from Reliance Digital for 76k.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Nice product actually and i really liked it...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not for gamingVery bad\n&#39;,
 &#39;One of the best laptop at this price\n&#39;,
 &#34;The mouse pad was damaged and there is no option for return or replacement. It just has a hp customer number to call and it is not getting connected either. U don&#39;t have option to return straight away when you found the item is damaged. Pathetic!\n&#34;,
 &#39;A wonderful piece to begin with. Good hardware along with latest software. Dual speakers give excellent sound quality. Screen too is good. Not yet tried any games but surely it will be a great experience considering the Nvidia 2 GB graphics card and stunning 8 GBs of RAM.\n&#39;,
 &#34;packing first of all. LAN port and one USB port are loose, gets disconnected very frequently, eventually can&#39;t use the USB port. Also the product is made in China. Don&#39;t know whether original or not!\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very slow.. the screen takes forever to open.. certainly not performance I would expect for a  8GB RAM machine, more of 512Mb RAM, it&#39;s that slow.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Like it\n&#39;,
 &#39;I really satisfied with this product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazing laptop at this price range\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop is as per the specifications. Delivery was prompt. Very nice Laptop and useful and recommended for other to purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Build quality is good but you can get much more specifications in this price if you buy lenovo or Asus laptops\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is smooth and fast owing to the SSD. Couple of disappointments1. No Backlit keyboard - Amazon does not mention it but the responses I received did mention a backlit keyboard. I suppose it was the seller. Hope Amazon had better mechanism around it.2. No 5G wireless - At this price point, it is quite surprising that the wifi adapter provided does not support 5Ghz as it is a single band wifi adapter. Thats a big bummer for me. Again hope that this information was mentioned by Amazon in the product description.Rest the performance is good so far. Good battery life and performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good configuration in this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good laptop... i5 8th gen 1tb+256gb ssd it&#39;s  work nice. Fingers print scanner  is accurate..\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very good laptop.Perfomance is very nice and powerfull.\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a nice Laptop with great performance. I&#39;m quite satisfied with the performance of the product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Overall good performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not happy\n&#39;,
 &#34;After doing so much research, I decided to buy this product.Process of reboot is very fast because of 256 GB SSD drive. You get additional 1 TB HDD for media storage.The Display is full HD narrow bezel, so the screen looks wider.Sound quality is good. Fingerprint is very useful.Only thing I am missing is Backlit keyboard. In pavilion models, it is available but they are very costly.Its weight is approx 2 Kg, Design is very good. I mostly work on Excel so full size keyboard is useful for me.Battery backup is 6 hrs which is good.I would have loved to give it 5 stars but I am giving 1 star less because Amazon sent me an Invoice with wrong Serial number. For almost 1 month I was calling them regularly. Amazon refused to change their invoice due to some technical reasons &amp; gave me seller&#39;s contact number. Finally I managed to get the correct Invoice from the seller. Seller was customer friendly &amp; co-operative. He immediately sent me the correct invoice.But I am very disappointed with Amazon&#39;s customer service. The product is amazon fulfilled, still I had to call them again &amp; again. I will never forget the harassment I faced in this 1 month. We buy products online because we get huge discounts, but these are the technical problems we can get. Plus we don&#39;t get any accessories also.So the product is very good for personal use, 5 Star for the product. 1 Star for Amazon&#39;s Customer service.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Junk Laptop. The battery does not even get charged\n&#39;,
 &#39;Some scratch will be found on body but good condition\n&#39;,
 &#39;It’s an awesome laptop, light weight, sleek design, with just right configuration for home and light use. Bought it for my wife and she is happy with it. Cones with 4gb ram, 1TB hard disk and windows 10 loaded.The speed is ok not that slow, happy with performance.  Realiable HP product.Seller is awesome. Package comes with an OTP for safe delivery.Bought it with exchange for 21 K.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this laptop as it doesn&#39;t support 5GHz wifi band which is common in airtel and jio giga fibre for better speed (like 100 Mbps) . Now i have to live with 2.4 GHz WiFi band speed only. Pathetic description and Amazon is equally resposbile for this fault. My 10 years old laptop Compaq 510 support 5 GHz band while this year 2019 HP model doesn&#39;t support what a irony for all HP user.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good and functional for light use. I found the power button too small and usb slots too tight. Otherwise no complaints.\n&#39;,
 &#39;the processor is very slow when ever i use internet its just show loading loading.....nd process of copping file through other devices is also very slow. It eventually shows white screen. nd all this thing is happening from 1st day. Dont buy this product . Complete waste of money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfect laptop for business  users 14 inch screen with mat finish in low price all the spec is good having a msata name slot for SSD\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Satisfied with the product especially with battery backup.Initially some lag is there, now it works fine. Only thing is need to shutdown properly instead of hard shutdown.\n&#39;,
 &#34;At 1st I don&#39;t want to compare it with other productsUnder 24k it&#39;s good and never ever buy from Amazon bcz the delivery system of Amazon is so pathetic.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Slow performance observedNot supporting 5ghz network.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfect but require update and licence key for other apps\n&#39;,
 &#39;Always need to video shoot before opening package products...HP laptop not in packaging only charger received...zero value after paying full money... Laptop not packaged for charging to check battery life.... And completely laptop weight is missed ....too sad\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good laptop @ 22k. Right enough for a college student with decent performance. Little slow with 4GB memory. Pre installed Windows 10 Home &amp; MS Office. But, office needs to bought separately &amp; just use the MS account &amp; no installation needed to use office products. Nice screen &amp; nice looking laptop &amp; go for it, no issues.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Plz don&#39;t buy dis laptop it&#39;s not worth for 22k not so good to use its just for show off not a good product to sell in Amazon Very disappointed\n&#34;,
 &#39;it is a 3rd grade laptop which cannot open ms excel and takes its own time. Too slow for any operations. This laptop reminded me of 2002 when i used to study on school PC for my 2nd standard classs. Maybe it is more slower then that school PC.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just completed only 30days..not much rough use.. Product now is not getting on.. Very bad productVery bad product and very bad service..I strongly recommend no one to buy this\n&#39;,
 &#34;The HP 15 db0209au 15.6-inch Laptop (A4-9125/4GB/1TB/Windows 10/Integrated Graphics), Jet Black  is good for basic , moderate use.The description say it comes with anti-glare screen, but actually it doesn&#39;t have anti-glare screen.Its very slow, it takes a long time to open simple things like file explorer, MS Word, etc as Pre-installed Windows 10 is extremely slow.Not at all good for heavy games. But one can play light weight games.Microsoft applications like Word, etc ask for Product Key for activation which is not provided. So one might have to reinstall Microsoft office.Rest, the laptop is very light weight, quite sturdy n good looking with good keypad panel and touch pad.But this is what u can get at this price (bought at Rs.20,000/-)(P.S: One may try re-installing Windows10 or any other version to make the system run smoothly)\n&#34;,
 &#39;It’s not worthy for the money..it’s totally waste of money..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Windows too slow.  And this product too badAnd All so two members replace to Amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hang in windows 10 from day 1If u want to change windows no drivers will available in websiteIt become a dubba without driver of usb, Lan, wifi and others\n&#39;,
 &#39;Microsoft office not working\n&#39;,
 &#39;One of the best laptop in this price range . After compared with many other brnads in same range i choose HP for its brand value ..Full hd diplay core i5 8th generation 8gb ram , 1tb hdd , i installed ssd hdd in dvd compartment . So laptop is performing very good .Information for new buyers there is a m.2 ssd slot inside (pic attached)  so you can use both drive 1tb inbuilt and use 1 m.2 ssd also .The viewing angles are not great . But ok .Sound quality is good.Both graphics option availble to choose between on board intel graphics and Nvidia mx110.Battery life i m getting approx 3 hrBest part is weight of this lappy .. 1.77 kg only. And its not very thick . Its sleek.For gaming please go for mx150 graphics card option as this one has mx110 only .\n&#39;,
 &#39;I had ordered this HP laptop because of its low price according to this specifications and brand name HP.But after receiving this product, I had to face lots of issues, as it came with DOS version, so I installed the Windows 10 1809 ( latest version as of now) and whenever I try to charge this laptop while laptop is running I got a battery error notification &#34;Plugged in not charging&#34;.I had to call HP support center first, they gave some solutions but none worked, they even asked me to downgrade the windows so I Installed Windows 10 1803 but that also didn\&#39;t worked, so I thought may be replacing the laptop would fix it, but again in replaced laptop ( second laptop ) I got the same battery issue.So returned this product and I went for ASUS laptop (i5 8th gen/8gb, without graphics) which is running better, I already own few other laptops of ACER and Toshiba but never faced such an issue in new laptop. I also ordered ACER laptop with DOS i5 ( 7th gen ) 1.5 years back which is still working goodI have got the refund amount but this HP laptop is headache, think 1000 times before buying this.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop is gud but when i purchase i dont know that hp hardware does not support windows 7/8 . I love windows 7 but hp forces me use to windows 10 because usb drivers not working. third party drivers i installed but hp gives us some more features that not working in windows 7/8 but dont worry product is okay. and fan noise is low to figured it out either its on or off.today 26 may now its work perfectly I used mostly software like blender etc. machine is powerfull at that price. it is only negative point is video memory when you use heavy 3d software. only when this machine lag so much otherwise it working properly.I never played a single game in this machine.I think this will helps you a lot.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I got it from Amazon at a good affordable price. The product arrived my address a day before the suggested dates and the shipment was easy to track using proper ID. The product has a good sound quality however it is not as loud as  expected. It&#39;s average battery life is 4 to 7 hrs  depending on the usage. Overall it was a better experience. Thank u amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Laptop is all good at this price rangeNo heating issue or lagsSome will say Nvidia mx110 is not great for gaming but it is capable of running GTA5 at very high settings 60fps I have tried myself!Don&#39;t expect battery life like a fool if you play heavy games on the machine!It even runs PUBG at medium settings 40-60fps!It is a highly upgradeable budget gaming laptopUpdate:After 23 daysBattery life is great considered gaming apmost 2 hrs on games like far cry 5Also it runs far cry 4 ultra settingsFar cry 5and 6 on high settingsQuantom Break on medium settingsBattlefield 5 on high settingsBattlefield 1 on highest settingsSo far no issues\n&#34;,
 &#39;At this price its a okay laptop. Nothing is great. Its heavy and its screen is big disappointment -  had thick bezels, too much glare (not sure why they call is anti-glare screen), viewing angle is too narrow.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Am already having an HP i3 pavillion which is doing a great job till now. That&#39;s the only reason for me to purchase another laptop of i5 series when I think for an upgrade. I just got a fresher review only as this is too early for a review. Still the first impression I get from my laptop is good. Nice display, a bit more faster and good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Battery life more then 6 hours. Best hp laptop for this price.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is nice and good looking. But the major problem is it don&#39;t support 5ghz wifi band only 2.4 ghz is supported. Imagine paying almost 50k and again you have to purchase a wireless dongle of 5ghz. Battery drains very fast don&#39;t know the reason.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome Using Adobe illustrator and Visual Studio 17 over windows 10.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought the Windows 10 + Office + 256 GB SSD at less than 41k after Rs. 7.3k for old laptop + Rs. 1500 instant cashback HDFC offer and 6 months No Cost EMI (Rs. 6860 per month). I am convinced you cannot get this configuration at a better price.  Sound quality is great. Full HD is awesome (for movies and videos).  I am not a gamer, so I am unable to comment on suitability for gaming.  Boots is under 5 secs due to SSD. According to benchmark websites, an i5 8th Gen is almost as good as i7 8th Gen in terms of performance, so it meets my requirements (Programming, multi-tasking etc).  Free MS Office and Windows 10 lifetime.  It has a DVD Writer too. It has 8GB RAM and you can add 8 GB more after you receive it. It has an additional M2 slot in which you can add another SSD - no need to remove the DVD writer. I still cannot believe I got all of this in 41k. What are you waiting for?\n&#39;,
 &#39;This product has the feature of 256 GB Solid State Drive, 1 TB Hard Drive, 8GB RAM, etc..When I have received the laptop, I see the laptop does not have 1 TB hard drive which gives me a complete shock. I see only 238 GB SSD where the OS is installed. I am extremely disappointed that the hard drive is missing.I have checked the My computer, bios setting, disk management. Even the hard drive information shows only the 238GB SSD is available but no 1TB Hard Drive.I have reached out to amazon support. I am not sure when they will fix this. Worst delivery from Amazon ever.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The keyboard number key came out just after 3days .and this is not covered under warranty .\n&#39;,
 &#39;HP, Dell and Lenova are top three market leader in Laptop for last many years. After lot of study and referring lot of online review, I finally selected HP i5 8th generation , 8 GB RAM, (15q-ds1000TU ) laptop with inbuilt windows 10 and MS office (pre-installed). Also selected SSD (256GB) for fast boot up. As per past feedback, normal HDD gives more boot up time for Windows 10 while boot up is very for fast for SSD. It takes vary few seconds. However cost of laptop due to SSD is slight higher. Only small drawback is that SDD is 256 GB while HDD normally 1 TB capacity. However external hard disk can be connected with SDD if required.HP Laptop 15.6 inch full HD screen is very good. MS office licence version is preinstalled i.e. no trial version and no need to purchase extra. It is very good and its price of MS office and Windows 10 is already included.DVD drive is also provided.This laptop is very good for normal day to day jobs, coding for engineering college student.Quality of this HP Laptop is very good. Overall value for money. My rating is 5 star.\n&#39;,
 &#34;When I decided to buy this laptop I was worried about the negative comments but after using it for a month I feel like I took a good decision. I brought the 320 GB SSD version and it&#39;s quite fast. Till now I haven&#39;t faced any problem. Battery life is quite acceptable and goes up to on an average 4-5 hours. Speaker is clear. The webcam is also on a positive side. But what I fell the inbuilt keyboard will get damage soon. The quality of the inbuilt keyboard is extremely low. Overall I will say its a good product with in the price range but yes don&#39;t expect for a miracle with this laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Hi everyone I just bought this laptop...It&#39;s a little heavy as it seems but build quality is decent enough.But yeah keyboard is beauty cz of good travel and clicky buttons...Speakers are decent but not mind blowing..Screen is good and bright enough..Thanks to Amazon for good delivery..Thank you for that..That&#39;s my opinion about this fast laptop..\n&#34;,
 &#34;I have been using this laptop for about a month. This is value for money. I did not get any other laptop with SSD in this range. Looking at the price I was doubtful about the quality. Though plastic quality is not premium, it functions as expected. Boots up in less than a minute and ready to work as soon as you logon. I&#39;ve worked on numerous laptops before for office and personal use, but this one is on par with my office laptop worth 80K (that is also same config but premium).Pro:- Price, performance, has DVD drive, anti-glare screen, battery (4-5hours)Cons - Feels bulky, No backlit keys, Keyboard quality is average, Touch-pad buttons bit hard,If you are not carrying it around more and simply use at one place this laptop is good for you. It came with MS Office which is added advantage.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Very good battery life for all day. Fast charging. My business with amazon and others website. All day my laptop is on  and do all day working on this. That&#39;s why i said about battery. SSD give power boost. Super fast laptop. numeric keywords. Good Sound. Used by last 4 months with no issue. Original windows &amp; office gives more easily work. i5 processor with 8th generation. I don&#39;t know why people gives 3 star. I give 5 star rating with best honest reasons after 4 month.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I thought I would upgrade from i3 to i5 with SSD when my current Dell Inspiron malfunctioned.  There are multiple I5 models from different brands like Lenovo, Dell and even Asus but HP is the least costliest. I have chosen HP apprehensively, but I am pleaseantly flabbergasted at the price band, 45K, and overall performance of this laptop.  Apart from price, the delivery was also done quickly within a day, and the laptop is loaded with windows and Microsoft applications. To talk about performance, the laptop boots in just over 3 sec and is quite capable of running fairly complex programs. For instance, I have deployed python and SQL on the laptop and code gets executed without any lag.  The speed comes mainly from SSD which gives performance on par with i7. In terms of disadvantages, the laptop could have been better interms of display quality as youtube videos look bit dim at times but it&#39;s speed and build quality makes up for the minor flaws. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a laptop for doing a bit of complex coding to daily usage.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Very good laptop. Super fast bootung. Now slowness. No performance issue. Best for programmers and daily use.Gaming experience not tested.Good battery life.Good build quality. So many times this thing has fallen down.But no damages till. No much negatives except the mat display which personally i don&#39;t like much.And getting windows 10 with office basic is a plus. If you are going to purchase with lesser priced linux / DOS system of same configuration, I would suggest to rethink that decision as your time is again lost on installation and other stuff..Overall good and getting an ssd in this price range is too awesome.Worth buying and would suggest to anybody.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Superb experience with this laptop. Just boot up in less than 6sec. Premium design, light weight,b&amp;o sound effects fabulous also vary easy to use in night. Seller service is also good product packaging &amp; delivery in time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Go for it...very good display. Overall great product. Decent battery life\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice laptop metal build with M2 HDD\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not wastage of money but you can get better laptops at this price than this. This laptop isn&#39;t exactly as described. It&#39;s boot te is good(4 seconds). Battery life below average at this price. Not yet lagged(in 15 day usage). Display n its quality is average. Keyboard is fine. Not recommended for gaming and heavy users. Ssd is working best(the only benchmark I found).Overall it&#39;s a decent laptop with decent looks and specs. Nothing too good or exceptional about this laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It was really good product...i m buying for programming purpose...gaming is quite good...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Graphic is low only 1 gb which I can get more in this range of laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;This laptop is terrible. When i charge the battery,  it becomes extremely hot &amp; the back panel becomes too hot. The design itself is wrong. The exhaust fan is built above the speaker. Therefore,  the speaker panel becomes too hot after using for sometime. I know Amazon will not agree if i want to return the product. I regret wasting my Rs. 50,000 for this crap.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I spent half lakh for the product but it was totally disappointed.booting time is 15 minutes and shut down command is not working.really frustrated because of this product.built quality found okey but not working.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good specifications but product is demage\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is really good, except the keyboard when lit, some of the keys are not visible properly due to thin letter prints and the light could not pass through. I wonder how HP released it to market without testing this.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bought this recently from a HP store at Rs. 58500. At this price this is a good choice feature wise. It&#39;s like an all-rounder, not lacking too much in any specific area. I have used it only for few days. So far no problem; working smoothly.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Today was the first day of use and it felt awesome. Will update the review once used for more time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Heating affect the performance so much.\n&#39;,
 &#39;good product..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Prices are much high as compared to other laptops with same configuration.Most importantly it is hanging frequently. Amazon customer care responses after purchasing is worst.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I got this product as it was the perfect deal - A good price of 36k , and the flexibility to be upgraded.I purchased a WD 240GB SSD, and a Kingston 8GB DDR4 RAM as well, for a combined price of 5500.Although it seemed risky to &#34;unscrew and open&#34; up my laptop on the day of purchase itself, I don\&#39;t regret it now.After removing the optical drive, and replacing the caddy with the supplied HDD, and installing the SSD in the original HDD slot - I cloned the OS to the SSD.Now I have a blazing fast laptop with i5 , 12GB RAM , 240GB SSD + 1TB HDD for a combined price of Rs. 41000.The best experience indeed :)\n&#39;,
 &#39;waste buying.... slow nd hangs.... I prefer not to buy this.... many good products are there than this one.....\n&#39;,
 &#34;I like this laptop but it&#39;s Very slow. Anyone please help me to rectify my issues.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This machine is very slow. I bought it for my son&#39;s school studies. It&#39;s less than 2 months old and already feels as if it&#39;s years old. My recommendation is not to go for it online. Go to a branded retailer and buy it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Product does not have a new feel. Feels used. Very unsatisfied with the supplier\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good purchase for this amount. Speed ok, performance fine. if memory extend..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Received  late from scheduled date and now having software problem just after 15 days .\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very worst, it just jeeps buffering every time we try opening a new window or try to do something. Using it is a big torture if possible kindly take it bacj\n&#39;,
 &#39;Never buy,, this product hang frequently. And processor is not good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;very slow machine..i dont recommend this laptop.not worthyam going to return it back.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Is this laptop only good for gaming? or it&#39;s good for all purposes.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Amazing 😍 product 👌\n&#39;,
 &#39;The Product is Amazing.It is a Perfect budget gaming laptop.The Display is Amazing with narrowed bezel.Also Lightweight.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Warranty card will be provided inside the pack if I purchase online?\n&#39;,

 &#39;Best performance, battery backup good, havy uses 4hr,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good processor, 4 hrs battery backup, good deal in this range with 1 year warranty.Only problem is there isn&#39;t backlight keyboard.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Aesthetically good runs smooth but too costly I don&#39;t know why you will get same features 5000 thousand cheap it should have been around 44000 no backlit keyboard\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,

 &#39;Best\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good for any one\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is the great laptop for everyday use, most recommend for students. It also comes with a hp ink pen which is stylish and can perform many incredible actions. The powerful 10th gen intel core i3 processor combined with a ssd makes this laptop smoother and faster which can make every work possible. The 360 degree rotating hinge makes this a convertible laptop which can also work as tablet!\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Light weight ,good battery backup , it can be expandable to 16gb RAM. Slim design\n&#39;,
 &#39;Superb\n&#39;,
 &#34;Honestly, with the kind of specs and for it&#39;s price, it could have been better. It works like a mediocre laptop with normal specifications. Also PUBG mobile runs on the lowest resolution on this laptop.  If it can&#39;t run this game smoothly, I don&#39;t know about the rest of it. But it has pretty decent features. Not everything is disappointing about it, like the keyboard is super smooth along with the resolution. Also it&#39;s lightweight and the speakers are good.\n&#34;,
 &#34;After replacement, I got many problems again with this model. Both hardware and software of this laptop are worst. Don&#39;t waste your precious money for buying this laptop. Hp should return this laptop from market.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Rare specification.warranty provided by HP for one year onsite. weight almost 2.4 kg.no back light key board. silver body design look smoothly.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Complete plastic construction, delicate laptop,light weight.AMD graphics will give you trouble with Windows 10. Graphic drivers and windows 10 both are tall claims and low on delivery.3 big companies have lied together to bring out this cheap assembly (AMD,Microsoft, HP). My review is 3 star only because it is sold with DOS. and I am not sure if some one will use DOS in 2018 on laptops.If you have expert or time to patiently research yourself, you may succeed overcoming the display going blank.It will work well with Display chip disabled fully, hence dedicated graphics feature to be  subtracted from the spec.6-8Hr battery back up to be ready as 3 hours max, with fans turned off. Another lie.Frequent price drop is justifiable, it is worth about 18-200000 Rs range.Day 8 addition - with defective graphics driver or hardware projecting your screen on a TV or projector is ruled out. Making it a use less office laptop too.Day 330 - Key board gone, warranty expired already. When bought 6month warranty was still available, but took a chance base on HP brand.Write off.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Working on a laptop has become a nightmare ever since I have started working on HP 245 G6 laptop. The operating system I am using windows 10 64 bit and frankly speaking, its too slow to work simultaneously on different application. The hard part is only windows 10 64 bit drivers are available on the HP&#39;s support page; meaning you cannot run any other operating system (windows 7 or windows 8).Waiting for refund.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Performance wise laptop is good ..... almost similar performance my Fujitsu i3 (5th Gen) Laptop.But it&#39;s body material seem little cheap .... In nutshell, best laptop for under 20k.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Even though I got a dead pixel on the screen, Its totally worth it. Can&#39;t go through the pathetic replacement procedure, so keeping it. It&#39;s pretty small and compact.Installed Windows 10 and everything works fine. AMD display driver can be found on HP product website. It works better than the the one you get from Windso update. Also it doesn&#39;t have optical drive.(Not like we need it). 4GB ram does the job. 1TB storage is enough for average user. Amazing battery life with normal usage.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Screen in anti-glare which is important for laptops. The keyboard is smooth.It does not have an DVD drive, but neither does it have any port to install an off-market drive or a SSD in a SATA caddy. I was hoping that it would have a dummy DVD drive with a working sata port, but it doesn&#39;t even have a port or slot to install an SSD. You have to remove the HDD and exchange it for an SSD to boost the performance.I&#39;ve been using HP 245s for over 3 years including g4 and g5 and they are working flawlessly for years. I own 5 of these.As a maintenance measure to vacuum clean the old laptop, i took it apart and found absolutely no dust inside. It is well designed to prevent dust from entering the laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Laptop had activated in September 27 2018,and it&#39;s show 10 month warranty only it is look like old refurbished products, I got this laptop 30 Jan 2019 and it&#39;s activated on SEP 2018 ,yaa value for money and it has only 512 mb graphic card don&#39;t confuse with 2 GB , they are not change your laptop\n&#34;,
 &#34;Good laptop for average gaming and daily use but please make sure that your warranty is accurate because I had issue with the warranty of the product. Until now it&#39;s working fine and delivery was as expected.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Absolutely perfect. This works very good. The best thing about this laptop is this does not make any sound and does not heat up. the AMD processor is working good as expected. If you want the budget laptop for gaming this is perfect for it. The professional softwares like hitfilm Express is working fine on this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very bad every 5 minutes system will restart after that when be open any application no application open at that time window again restatIn two months 12 times window will be instal 5 minute bi is laptop ko chala kay nehi dekha please contact on my number 9622116472 agay kya karna hai koi hal solution bataye dil karta hai is ko utakay bahar fankdu\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its so bad.  Compeltely waste 22000/- . This laptop is not working properly, its very slow. So pls dont purchase. U hv to face lot of problems\n&#39;,
 &#39;excellent product little pricey...but go for it...u will get premium quality laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Waste of money, even h p support is worst.In the start keyboard and touchpad failed to work.Now tik sound is keep coming from the laptop called ho enter a ticket is assigned to them.Its more than 2 week no body came to fix the issue.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought my laptop just a week ago and Everything&#39;s good as mentioned and as expected but my fingerprint sensor doesn&#39;t work properly and it has heating issue. Well I love the sound system. Please suggest me something about the sensor. What do I do about it???\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Drop of price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very nice laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;👍\n&#39;,
 &#39;best affordable stylish 2 in 1 lap.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I just brought this laptopIt has very low sound.you need to sit next to laptopThere is shuttering/lag in display.Rest all features are good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice laptop from amazon.delivered before time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop keyboard does not work  please solve it\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros :Budget friendlyFast and furious with ryzen processor and Vega graphics.Nice battery lifeBuild qualityColour of the lappy makes this piece to another level, it is just pure classNice display ,thanks to FHD and anti glareThanks for providing 256 gb ssd, which makes speed more speeder😁😂.....Cons :Sound quality is not that greatI think 4 GB is waste for this kind of processor, and graphics......... Since it is upgrdable to 16 gb no prob with that.....  8gb will be the best option.....\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst laptop don&#39;t buy...lags too much...charge doesn&#39;t stand an hour....bad web cam...waste of money only looks great....\n&#34;,
 &#39;Weighs too much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very quick, good display, pre-installed anti-virus and office free for 1 month\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product comes with good quality, i like it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderful packing, shipping and product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is fine but battery consumption is high\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is good but comes with 4gb ram which is totally disappointing because ryzen processessor comes with vega  Graphics and if you want to play games then you definitely should upgrade ram upto 8gb ram with dual channel...Yes,I played assassin&#39;s creed black flag medium settings at 20-25 Fps which is really good at price and also mafia 2 at high 30fps..Display- Dispaly is not that great cause it looks more white but you can change saturation for color depthness (i tried..)Sound- Sound is loud but not clear..Processor- It is faster than intel 8th gen and similar to i5 6th and nearly lower than i5 7th genGraphics - you can&#39;t get that type of integrated graphic card at such low price\n&#34;,
 &#39;Received Today.As Of Now working Very Good and also very  good design. I will update after using 1 month\n&#39;,
 &#39;Warranty issued is wrong date. Kindly call me back\n&#39;,
 &#39;Up till now(2weeks) everything  is fine .Cheers\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is smooth and fast owing to the SSD. Couple of disappointments1. No Backlit keyboard - Amazon does not mention it but the responses I received did mention a backlit keyboard. I suppose it was the seller. Hope Amazon had better mechanism around it.2. No 5G wireless - At this price point, it is quite surprising that the wifi adapter provided does not support 5Ghz as it is a single band wifi adapter. Thats a big bummer for me. Again hope that this information was mentioned by Amazon in the product description.Rest the performance is good so far. Good battery life and performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good configuration in this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good laptop... i5 8th gen 1tb+256gb ssd it&#39;s  work nice. Fingers print scanner  is accurate..\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very good laptop.Perfomance is very nice and powerfull.\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a nice Laptop with great performance. I&#39;m quite satisfied with the performance of the product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Overall good performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not happy\n&#39;,
 &#34;After doing so much research, I decided to buy this product.Process of reboot is very fast because of 256 GB SSD drive. You get additional 1 TB HDD for media storage.The Display is full HD narrow bezel, so the screen looks wider.Sound quality is good. Fingerprint is very useful.Only thing I am missing is Backlit keyboard. In pavilion models, it is available but they are very costly.Its weight is approx 2 Kg, Design is very good. I mostly work on Excel so full size keyboard is useful for me.Battery backup is 6 hrs which is good.I would have loved to give it 5 stars but I am giving 1 star less because Amazon sent me an Invoice with wrong Serial number. For almost 1 month I was calling them regularly. Amazon refused to change their invoice due to some technical reasons &amp; gave me seller&#39;s contact number. Finally I managed to get the correct Invoice from the seller. Seller was customer friendly &amp; co-operative. He immediately sent me the correct invoice.But I am very disappointed with Amazon&#39;s customer service. The product is amazon fulfilled, still I had to call them again &amp; again. I will never forget the harassment I faced in this 1 month. We buy products online because we get huge discounts, but these are the technical problems we can get. Plus we don&#39;t get any accessories also.So the product is very good for personal use, 5 Star for the product. 1 Star for Amazon&#39;s Customer service.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Hello, I really liked the laptop, I purchased it from the seller &#34;Binary Computers&#34;. But after installing Windows OS and HP support software , I realized that three months of warranty is already gone. When I contacted HP regarding the same with my invoice. They said that the invoice provided by Amazon is not a valid one. I am stuck without warranty, No help from Amazon, or HP. Now stuck with a warranty-less laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good product with decent look. I was using core i3 series laptop but o/s installation in this system took lesser time than i3 system.Pros:1. Very light weight, seems impossible in this price segment as most of light weight laptops are expensive.2. Speed is good3. Battery backup : only 40% used in last 3 hours. Total backup should be 7 hours+4. Fast ChargingCons:Colour options not available.\n&#39;,
 &#39;ProsAMD APUamples storage 1TBPRICE TO PERFORMENCE IS THE BESTFAST CHARGING AND AMPLE BATTERY LIFECAN RUN GAMES IN MEDIUM SETTINGSCONSRAM IS LOWNO WINDOWS  8.1 SUPPORTDISPLAY IS A BIT DULLOVERALL I RECOMMEND IT\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall nice product at this price...if you order DOS product then install windows then touchpad work properly...average batry life..update all drivers from hp offical site then most of function work properly..under 25k go for it.👍Ryzen is good processor u can relate it to i3 7th gen.\n&#39;,
 &#34;A wonderful buy provided you are willing to top-up its memory with an SSD and a RAM. Battery life lasts somewhere between 4-5 hours even on continuous usage. Overall, I&#39;m happy I got the deal in 25 grand.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop with Full Year Warranty and Brand New! After getting the laptop. Received after 4 to 5 business days. Had it shipped from Punjab to Kerala. It was factory sealed. Please install drivers from the support website and also install HP support assist.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Performance is very good considering it&#39;s price. Despite having a slow HDD, it boots very fast. Battery life is user dependent and with my usage of only surfing web, it lasts about 4-5Hrs. Display is a cheap quality panel but considering it&#39;s price it&#39;s right. It&#39;s very light weight and sturdy in nature. Most useful feature is having a large variety of I/O port and a RJ45 port which nowadays gone missing from laptop.PS - I&#39;ll suggest every potential buyers and owners of this laptop to upgrade to a SSD, it&#39;ll improve battery life and system will also be much faster.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have purchased the product , as skeptical, as this was a product with a new processor and I wanted to use it with LINUX operating system. I  had browsed the net and found that there were initial teething problems  and was apprehensive,  however I have installed the ARCH LINUX and though have to carry on with installing the full graphical environment, I had checked on the live bootable version, it seems to be working.  I have to still delve deeper and get the most from this CPU.  NO heating problems, Battery life seems to be good, however a thourough check will need to be done. wifi good, bluetooth to be tested. Sound reasonable. What more would you want.  Yes the case gets smeared by finger prints, ASUS case is far better.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is good.. But faced an issue refarding display and  you cant update warranty on hp website.. As they told that seller is unauthorized so we cant update warranty details... So beware of this....Conclusion dont buy this laptop... As you will surely face issues regarding warranty for this...No support from amazon and hp side.....\n&#39;,
 &#34;Definitely faster than slightly the more expensive laptops with intel i3 processors. At just over 1.5 kgs, very portable. High performance interior in a cheaper looking exterior !Warranty is not a concern. Mine had 10 months of manufactures warranty left, according to the HP website. If you call HP support with the original invoice having the serial number, this will be resolved. If your invoice doesn&#39;t have the serial number, you have to ask Amazon and the seller to add it in the invoice. Only then it&#39;s valid.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Battery is average not justify its specifications. battery life is upto 5 hours only not 13 hours . cheat by amazon processor may be slow after some time its a average product only.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfect Laptop for Middle class buyers, and performance only little slow, Finishing is good and packing also good ...\n&#39;,
 &#34;Battery drains even in shutdown mode.It is just 2 months past i purchased this laptop, i am facing battery draining issue. I certainly believe this problem is their since day one, and i regret i didn&#39;t check on buying it.Support from HP is poor when you have ubuntu installed. They don&#39;t have tools to diagnose if there is any hardware problem.Even wifi hardware is not comptabile to ubuntu.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Received As expected.It&#39;s monster for regular office usage.Battery life 4+ hours.HD Display.Compact design.HP trade mark Build quality.Working perfectly. Loved it 🤩Go for it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Picture is very good ,using since one month .no prob at all\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good laptop on budget. Few tweaks such as increasing the ram size and getting a SSD drive installed. And you are on the fast lane.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It was an awesome product bought 2 months back and no problem till now and loving it it has a great battery life and great sound ...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Got the laptop delivered on 20th October n on 22nd October the return window is closed, though the description says that the return window closes on 23rd October.The speakers are giving a jarring sound n not working properly.  Not happy for the sound n unable to return/replace the same.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best in budget...........add extra 4gb of ram if possible for good experience.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen is not bright and clear\n&#39;,
 &#39;Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\&#39;t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&amp;O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed &amp; higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (&#34;HP assistant&#34; is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\&#39;t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop &amp; my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I was looking for a laptop that is:1. Two in one Laptop plus tablet that is 360 degree foldable but not detachable  and comes with a free pen2. Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don&#39;t do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t get everything at this price point.  It&#39;s about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a &#39;cool&#39; look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)\n&#34;,
 &#34;With premium fit and finish to go with all the features mentioned, this model is a good combination of both form and functionality. The only grouse was that there was some lag initially while booting up, but that seems to have gone away on its own now. Also, it&#39;s only been a few weeks since I&#39;ve been using it, so I can&#39;t speak for its durability. This particular piece is a replacement piece - the original one that was delivered refused to start! So am a little worried - my experience with HP products has been great in the past, so let&#39;s hope this one also continues to reinforce that.Also, Get 10% cb and 6 months extended warranty by ordering through wplov .in/63\n&#34;,
 &#34;I bought this product in a hurry during Diwali time and I regret almost daily. Below are a few but most critical issues I have faced ever since I bought this laptop1) Extremely slow and loading takes hell lot of time2) Though manual update is enabled system goes for auto windows update in every 2 days time. Updates runs for 6/7 hours which means you never get time to use the laptop3) No matter how many times you run shut down command the laptop continues to be on unless you physically shut it down4) can&#39;t even open 4 Window tabs simultaneously as it crashes5) Overall nice looking fancy gadget without any practical utilities..Extremely disappointing and hope I can get it replaced.\n&#34;,
 &#39;\xa0This laptop has an SSHD for boot up , so ideally it should be fast and smooth but sadly that is not at all the case , the apps crash and the laptop lags and becomes irresponsive as soon as you shift to tablet mode also it has a problem of over heating. All in all the performance is highly dissatisfactory. I have a Macbookpro that i bought in 2014 and even that works better than the new HP x360 that i got. Also , even after constant attempts Amazon has not yet helped me getting a refund or even a replacement for the product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought it less than 10 days ago. Got a faulty product. Very slow and hanging always. Overheating too in 5 min. Very disappointed with HP and Amazon. Need replacement!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Have been using this laptop for the last 3 months and the issues seem to never end. It looks good, feels good and there ends the matter. I am already facing issues with the audio, the company claims it to be a software update issue. The heat sink stopped working and it&#39;s been more than 15 days since the complaint has been raised yet they have to replace the part not sure of they are yet to manufacturer it. Pathetic after sales service. The laptop is slower than a P1 system. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Will update this review once the part is replaced to see if it improves the performance.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is an awesome laptop. It has premium look. And as some review mentioned it is a bit slow with 4 GB ram but once you upgrade it to 8GB it runs smoothly without any single lag. After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe&#39;s light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn&#39;t actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it&#39;s deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have purchased HP Pavilion x360 14 inch, What a fantastic machine it is!  Screen touch, booting speed is really extra ordinary\n&#39;,
 &#34;Battery life won&#39;t even standby for 3 hours, the machine is super slow you can&#39;t open up more than four tabs in the browser. Any applications startup seems very slow very disappointed, deceived by the looks 😣\n&#34;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop thinking its vfm with what&#39;s offered at the discounted price, but I was so wrong.Let&#39;s see what I got for the price I paid.1st laptop: It arrived, I booted it up and updated everything, but as it was new I did not bothered to check around but upon later I came to know it was a defrctive one. The fan inside was touching some part because of which it used to make weird sound and this caused it too rotate slow. Because of this the cpu was not able to get enough air and it caused the cpu to cut down power which slowed down the whole laptop. Also the seal was tampered one so I decided to file for a replacement.Amazon representatives were of no help even after 3 calls and conversation of several hours, finally 4 days later my replacement was confirmed. Until then the representative made sure that they tried every single trick on me to force me to keep the product and keep me stalling.Replacement arrived after 2 days of confirmation and the old one was picked up at the same time.Replaced Laptop: Screen bleeding or burn in not so sure of but it was present, screen upper whole part was yellow and the other than that the whole screen was white. Left side panel was not fitting properly and something was coming out of it, keyboard was hit and miss, it sometimes did not took input.As it was a replacement, asking amazon to take it back was not going to be possible as I had seen how they were acting when they had to send in a replacement. Went ahead and filed a complain with hp, they sent an engineer who checked out the laprop and to his surprise the laptop&#39;s hard disk lock was broke which caused improper fitting of panel and thing poppong out of panel. He was not able to diagnose what the issue was with the panel but it was surely visible and even he was confused. The keyboard issue was also detected and he asked me what would I like, a replacement or a repair.As my return window with amazon was available and also hp has 11 days replacement option, I went ahead for replacement, to which I was provided a doa letter which I had to send to amazon and procure a replacement.I went ahead called up amazon, to my surprise the guy was hellbent to send an amazon technical representative at my place to diagnose the laptop, even though hp&#39;s own engineer had already carried it out, well location was not in their covered facility due to which they finally asked me what I want and I went for return as replacement for the third time was just illogical.My money was refunded, and to those who are willing to buy it, let me shed some light on another issue:Laptop Price that I had paid Rs50990HP&#39;s MRP Rs59990 upon hp&#39;s discount at store or online store you will end up paying from 55k to 56k.But as I bought the laptop from another online retailer other than their own website or local resellers, it was not eligible for hp&#39;s offers that can get you 1st year adp with 2 year extended warranty for Rs999. I was forced to shell out Rs6999 which will get me only 2 years extended warranty nothing else.So the lesson i learnt was buy products from exclusive partners where you can get offers, or else you will end up shelling out more money for the same thing.I am attaching video where you can see how the fan caused the cpu to drop down speed from 100mbps to 4mbps and photos wjere you can see faulty replacement for your reference.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Everything is good, but the laptop bag was not given by you, for which I am disatisfied. A laptop bag is an essential accessory along with a laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Absolutely crap at gaming. Nvidia doesn&#39;t help at all.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great design with pavilion x360 mode. Well managed for tablet view. Sound quality is great. All i needed a better battery backup for long time Play back for video and game. Performance is good with win10. Thanks to HP for this and amazon for timely delivery.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good laptop. Battery life could have been better. Style and look is awesome. Best performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great display and handy.  Its just an i3 so not for gaming.  Good for all normal use.  Streaming, movies,  browing and making presentations.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice product but screen display need improvement.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Except battery life, it is worth for every penny\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Well built product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Window is not started and open.foulty after  10days.laptop is bad candition deleverd to me.after 10day how to step return.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Complete plastic construction, delicate laptop,light weight.AMD graphics will give you trouble with Windows 10. Graphic drivers and windows 10 both are tall claims and low on delivery.3 big companies have lied together to bring out this cheap assembly (AMD,Microsoft, HP). My review is 3 star only because it is sold with DOS. and I am not sure if some one will use DOS in 2018 on laptops.If you have expert or time to patiently research yourself, you may succeed overcoming the display going blank.It will work well with Display chip disabled fully, hence dedicated graphics feature to be  subtracted from the spec.6-8Hr battery back up to be ready as 3 hours max, with fans turned off. Another lie.Frequent price drop is justifiable, it is worth about 18-200000 Rs range.Day 8 addition - with defective graphics driver or hardware projecting your screen on a TV or projector is ruled out. Making it a use less office laptop too.Day 330 - Key board gone, warranty expired already. When bought 6month warranty was still available, but took a chance base on HP brand.Write off.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Working on a laptop has become a nightmare ever since I have started working on HP 245 G6 laptop. The operating system I am using windows 10 64 bit and frankly speaking, its too slow to work simultaneously on different application. The hard part is only windows 10 64 bit drivers are available on the HP&#39;s support page; meaning you cannot run any other operating system (windows 7 or windows 8).Waiting for refund.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Performance wise laptop is good ..... almost similar performance my Fujitsu i3 (5th Gen) Laptop.But it&#39;s body material seem little cheap .... In nutshell, best laptop for under 20k.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Even though I got a dead pixel on the screen, Its totally worth it. Can&#39;t go through the pathetic replacement procedure, so keeping it. It&#39;s pretty small and compact.Installed Windows 10 and everything works fine. AMD display driver can be found on HP product website. It works better than the the one you get from Windso update. Also it doesn&#39;t have optical drive.(Not like we need it). 4GB ram does the job. 1TB storage is enough for average user. Amazing battery life with normal usage.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Screen in anti-glare which is important for laptops. The keyboard is smooth.It does not have an DVD drive, but neither does it have any port to install an off-market drive or a SSD in a SATA caddy. I was hoping that it would have a dummy DVD drive with a working sata port, but it doesn&#39;t even have a port or slot to install an SSD. You have to remove the HDD and exchange it for an SSD to boost the performance.I&#39;ve been using HP 245s for over 3 years including g4 and g5 and they are working flawlessly for years. I own 5 of these.As a maintenance measure to vacuum clean the old laptop, i took it apart and found absolutely no dust inside. It is well designed to prevent dust from entering the laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Laptop had activated in September 27 2018,and it&#39;s show 10 month warranty only it is look like old refurbished products, I got this laptop 30 Jan 2019 and it&#39;s activated on SEP 2018 ,yaa value for money and it has only 512 mb graphic card don&#39;t confuse with 2 GB , they are not change your laptop\n&#34;,
 &#34;Good laptop for average gaming and daily use but please make sure that your warranty is accurate because I had issue with the warranty of the product. Until now it&#39;s working fine and delivery was as expected.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Absolutely perfect. This works very good. The best thing about this laptop is this does not make any sound and does not heat up. the AMD processor is working good as expected. If you want the budget laptop for gaming this is perfect for it. The professional softwares like hitfilm Express is working fine on this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very bad every 5 minutes system will restart after that when be open any application no application open at that time window again restatIn two months 12 times window will be instal 5 minute bi is laptop ko chala kay nehi dekha please contact on my number 9622116472 agay kya karna hai koi hal solution bataye dil karta hai is ko utakay bahar fankdu\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its so bad.  Compeltely waste 22000/- . This laptop is not working properly, its very slow. So pls dont purchase. U hv to face lot of problems\n&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m truly satisfied with the performance of the laptop and the battery backup especially considering the cost I paid for this.Also, GET 10% CASHBACK + 6 Month Extended Warranty In this Laptop by Ordering through vqr .in/aHope this helps! If helped then Please Press the Helpful Button.Happy Purchasing\n&#34;,
 &#39;Main problem is...kindly mention in the product menu that AMAZON not give any CD/ PENDRIVE for laptop installation. The buyer should go to CSC centre and after paying 1000 Ra they are installing the software . Discount no use\n&#39;,
 &#34;It is a good average device,but it has slow processor.Most Important:It support only Win 10 64bit,other operating system&#39;s drivers are not available even on the official website of HP.I have checked the device with Win 7 and almost every function was not even available like I was not able to connect my PD,phone etc.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Not good built quality .. performance not good .very slow.Built quality is very very poor\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s awesome and everything was great budget laptops are the best for office purposes\n&#34;,
 &#39;over all good but after format with win 7 this laptop may required drivers. driver cd not received with laptop\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this laptopU can use only window 10In down than en 10U can not use it&#39;s any Port andWindow 10 There are Hanging issueDon&#39;t buy if u don&#39;t want to waste ur money\n&#34;,

 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent condition, looks brand new. Windows 7 and office 2007 are additional gems.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product received was great condition. More than i expected. Just a few dents on panel , rest all, its like brand new.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Received on time and laptop is as expected.  Initial check done with performance and battery.  Good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Charger is not original and is in very poor condition. Almost broken.  Touch pad also used very extensively. Second hand looks from all angles. I hope it works well for 2 =3 years.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Do not buy worst laptop I&#39;ve ever purchase\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome Worth using\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased this HP g250 G6 core i3,but has only six month warranty remain as shown in HP website..\n&#39;,
 &#39;good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good item\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Betterment\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not flexibleHeavier to carry forward\n&#39;,
 &#34;I like it&#39;s look which is too sexy, and the features is like a blossom nothing can express....the battery life is minure short as expected...but still good working about 5-7 hours &amp; the charging time required is too short said to be fast charging.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;The build is amazing the plastics are nice and the chasis is aluminium. Comes loaded with spec. Probably the the most ideal laptop for now. The boot time is under 6 secs which is pretty good. The only downside the screen lacks anti reflective properties, which is not much of a problem considering the FHD IPS display is very good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought this thing in November from a local store for about 68500 and this is just perfect for a working class person❤️\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros: is stylish, has long batter life, responsive stylus pen, good configuration.Cons: hangs sometimes, bad build quality with respect to material used in body, bad online support for this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery life is poor. Not as per expectation\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is nice, built quality is awesome. Battery backup is average. Sound quality is good but not so loud, B&amp;O fails over here. Rest performance wise this laptop is beast, superb performance. Easy to carry, you can buy without any hesitation.Bought it from local store for 90k only🙂\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice pc...no heating issue...no lag in run... Very smooth performance...buid quality is awesome...sound system is not so loud but sufficient... battery backup is upto 6 hours approx...if you want to purchase it ...go offline on your nearest Store...buy it without any hesitation... when it comes to performance...it  is very nice pc...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wasting of money like simply throwing in fire.worst quality and worst support from hp\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have a doubt in mind on buying a refurbished product; but the overall  performance of the product is very good. I am very much using it from day 1 inwards, and it is giving me good speed and performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Crap product. Battery does not charge over 60%. Stuck at blue screen at start up. Was bought for my mother who is not a frequent user. Stopped working exactly on 11th day ( 10 day return policy). Would not recommend this product for anyone\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very nice condition .. appreciated the way the laptop is handled .. thank you\n&#39;,
 &#39;Robust in buld, windows 10 preloaded. Drivers are not installed by makers. Battery back up upto 60 min after full charge, touch pad 75% only sensible.\n&#39;,
 &#39;😧😔😫\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not working properly.  First few day good in work and now not in good. I want to replace it now.....\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome deal. Value for money.. Great product at best price.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Its HP&#39;s basic core i3 laptop with Windows. Have been using it for a week now. Works smooth\n&#34;,
 &#39;Junk Laptop. The battery does not even get charged\n&#39;,
 &#39;Some scratch will be found on body but good condition\n&#39;,
 &#39;I got an international variant\n&#39;,
 &#39;After just 3 months of usage laptop is hanging like hell. Also getting lots of internal system errors along with black screen automatically. Hardware is not up to the mark.worst part is customer care support number given are not working.Could opt for other laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fast charging and also light weight which is easier to carry while travelling. Overall good experience. Only disadvantage is no light is lit during charging neither on adapter nor on laptop...\n&#39;,
 &#39;I was in search for a good quality laptop for my parents. The requirement was - Should be good quality, with NO DVD drive (so it can be thin), good screen under 14&#34; size, big keys but overall small keyboard, Sleek and under 2KG, rate ~35K, With MS office pre-installed, etc.Surprisingly for me, this checked all the boxes. The initial feel was that as a great product for my parents. Only time will tell if this holds up to the expectation. However, currently happy with the purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hi friends,I have purchase the Laptop on 18th June 2019 . Its good for look and size . keyboard also nice , touchpad good looks like mac . Normal work its best laptop .But its too slow .If u r ready to use only excel  or data entry . then u can go for it . else go for  latest  version.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t have any word to express its slowness. Laptop is very very slow &amp; taking too much time to boot &amp; hanged frequently.  This is genuine review after 2 months of use. PLease please do not buy this laptop, I have facing lot of problem.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Too much slow laptop. Worst of mony. No support to HP. Not support to ios bluetooth. I have atom processor but atom is fast compare than i3.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Slim and beautiful.easy to initialise but I found it little slow means sometimes it takes a little more time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice n sleek laptop... But no warranty card recd along with the unit and also the import was 8 months old... This indicates the old stock is being deliverd... Msg for Amazon to look into the matter n resolve the issue ASAP... Or return ll be initiated.... Thanks\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very low RAM ...takes a lot of time to boot and even open simple applications like word dont open for atleast 15 secs. MS photos just doesnt open .\n&#39;,
 &#34;Gaming is far... Hangs like any thing. I use this only to check my office emails and and some basic work but it hangs a lot. Din&#39;t expect this from HP.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I am having issue with performance. it&#39;s too slow for 8 gb.and gets stuck with menu or chrome sometimes...I need to replace or repair it.how can I get a help.\n&#34;,
 &#39;All good, fan noise is too much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its not have DVD driver\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen flickering at refresh rate 60htz, works fine at 40 htz. resolved delete intel graphic new version and download previous version. No flickering till now.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice laptop for professional use but if u are buying this then please add ssd in this for buttery smooth experienceBattery life is good enough and the best you will get the after sale service by HP.\n&#39;,
 &#34;My uncle had bought this laptop and this laptop is gaming but have professional look. It&#39;s outer pad is so smooth and scratchless . Each and every game whether GTA 5 works very smoothly on this laptop .\n&#34;,
 &#39;Pros :Budget friendlyFast and furious with ryzen processor and Vega graphics.Nice battery lifeBuild qualityColour of the lappy makes this piece to another level, it is just pure classNice display ,thanks to FHD and anti glareThanks for providing 256 gb ssd, which makes speed more speeder😁😂.....Cons :Sound quality is not that greatI think 4 GB is waste for this kind of processor, and graphics......... Since it is upgrdable to 16 gb no prob with that.....  8gb will be the best option.....\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst laptop don&#39;t buy...lags too much...charge doesn&#39;t stand an hour....bad web cam...waste of money only looks great....\n&#34;,
 &#39;Weighs too much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very quick, good display, pre-installed anti-virus and office free for 1 month\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product comes with good quality, i like it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderful packing, shipping and product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is fine but battery consumption is high\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is good but comes with 4gb ram which is totally disappointing because ryzen processessor comes with vega  Graphics and if you want to play games then you definitely should upgrade ram upto 8gb ram with dual channel...Yes,I played assassin&#39;s creed black flag medium settings at 20-25 Fps which is really good at price and also mafia 2 at high 30fps..Display- Dispaly is not that great cause it looks more white but you can change saturation for color depthness (i tried..)Sound- Sound is loud but not clear..Processor- It is faster than intel 8th gen and similar to i5 6th and nearly lower than i5 7th genGraphics - you can&#39;t get that type of integrated graphic card at such low price\n&#34;,
 &#39;Best budget gaming laptop. My only concern is the battery life. In battery it lasts for 3.5 hours if you game, 4-5 hours if you watch a movie and 6 hours if you work.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Important Message: Seller will sell you very very old product with already expired warranty and on a bundled extended warranty which varied between 6 month or less based on how old is your product. Don&#39;t panic, kindly contact HP India support center with your amazon purchase bill with product serial number and they are normally kind enough to reset your product brand warranty. Mine is still under process.Product Review: Let me set the expectation straight, it is a budget laptop.Build quality is plastic, but do not flexes much. Screen is not IPS, but HD quality and anti reflective. Key board is well layed out, but I find the back lit LEDs are bit too bright to my choice. Camera is okeyish, mic and sound is adequate; good for your regular skype calls.1 TB SATA and a old school DVD writer means, laptop is heavy. I would any day prefer to trade off DVD writer for some reduction in weight. Mind you, you will need a table to work on it for long.MS office 2019 H&amp;S comes as lifetime free, but please follow process mentioned in Amazon video to get it activated. Actually, you will have to log in into your MS account from the installed word, activate Office2019 and then download and install it, as the installed version is Office365 trial.As expected with sATA, booting will take some time. I am not a gamer, so can&#39;t comment on that. Battery back up is very good for the price, expect 4-5 hours with regular work.Too early to comment on performance, but again it is Ryzen and not i5 and cost some 5k less.Overall, I would term it as a perfect home laptop for every one&#39; use.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good configuration. Nice looks. Value for money laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop warranty only 2 months remaining... Amazon why cheat us? Now what I do??\n&#39;,
 &#39;Like the color dont like delivery timingOverall the product is very good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice one\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Superb product superb build wuality\n&#39;,
 &#34;Before I write a review I want the readers to understand that it&#39;s my honest review and experience. Please don&#39;t go for this product specially online. Try to go to store and look for other option in this button. I swear I never use a laptop worse than this. My Sony Vio E series was far better with i3 processor.If we talk about the value for money, it&#39;s really not. Battery life is poor. Optane memory is to fool us. You will. It find a performance of i5 8th and optane memory. Nvidia graphics card will not work individually. Got blue screen within 7days of purchase. The worst part is customer care. My call disconnected several time and no response on email. Choice is up to you, it might not be a case with everyone but I&#39;m facing it for the price I paid for HP. Pen with the laptop is of worst quality.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Amazon provided extremely poor delivery. Took 13 days to deliver the product. I had to cancel and reorder the product. Overall laptop is good including build and performance.Pros: elegant looks, screen quality excellent (5/5), track and keyboard smooth, performance wise good, quick start/ boot due to optane (5/5), sound level high (4/5) had heating issues at first but after replacement its perfectly fine (5/5)Cons: touch screen 3/5 (sometimes touch doesn&#39;t response well, not very accurate for sketching using stylus,  leave hand marks behind on sketch while using stylus), had heating issues on medium gaming or while using tablet mode, sound bar is on keyboard side so while using tent mode or tablet mode sound becomes little feeble, battery life is not as shown in description- works 3.5-4 hr on video streaming, sound quality could be made better.\n&#34;,
 &#34;The laptop is hanging too much probably a manufacturing defect.... 10 days haven&#39;t completed yet..... So want to return\n&#34;,
 &#39;Do not fall for the amazon descriptionThere is no world cameraThe RAM is 8 GB nit 16GB as given in product descriptionAnd Amazon doesnt even provide a HP box with the laptopAlso it is mentioned that the battery life is around 8 hoursIts 4 to 5 hours actuallyPlease update the product detailsHighly Dissatisfied\n&#39;,
 &#39;Item was found defective out of the box with faulty components.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I love the laptop.Light easy to carry around.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great\n&#39;,
 &#39;One of the best\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;visit  drtechnno  dot  com for videos and youtube channel &#34;drtechnno&#34;I have made lot of videos on this model, do check outAdvantages:1. Fingerprint sensor works very fast2. Mx130 graphics which is almost same as previous Gen 940mx for mod gaming3. Full HD resolution screen4. 360 degree rotatable screen.5. Intel Optane 16gb faster than a SSHD. It\&#39;s a dedicated memory in the m.2 SSD slot6. Micro bezel screen which makes the laptop really compact.7. Easy upgradability by just removing back screws.Both RAM and SSD is easily accessible than previous gen. Previous gen SSD was easy to access but ram was on other side of motherboard. So needed complete disassembly.8. WILL UPDATE SOON as was busy upgrading to a proper ssdCons:Don\&#39;t buy if not planning to invest in a ssdUpdate 16/6/2018touch is as usual awesome and sensitivebattery life is 4-6 hours depending on usage but 9 hours is doubtful.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Received Today.As Of Now working Very Good and also very  good design. I will update after using 1 month\n&#39;,
 &#39;Warranty issued is wrong date. Kindly call me back\n&#39;,
 &#39;Up till now(2weeks) everything  is fine .Cheers\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worth product bad quality unhappy with this no CD drive and shoft ware installation is to much difficult so total money weastage\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is road side product, if by mistake you buy they will not take return back.....\n&#39;,
 &#39;The worst laptop I have got till date...Have used it only for 3 times in a year and the hard disk got crashed..Amazon I request for a complete refund or atleast 80% of the amount..seriously this ws height....How can Amazon sell such worst products...highly disappointed\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not Good Product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not good,\n&#39;,
 &#34;I got the product which is entirely different from the pictures given by the seller.I replaced it and I got the same product again.By seeing these pictures don&#39;t buy this product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent look.. performance is average\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop thinking its vfm with what&#39;s offered at the discounted price, but I was so wrong.Let&#39;s see what I got for the price I paid.1st laptop: It arrived, I booted it up and updated everything, but as it was new I did not bothered to check around but upon later I came to know it was a defrctive one. The fan inside was touching some part because of which it used to make weird sound and this caused it too rotate slow. Because of this the cpu was not able to get enough air and it caused the cpu to cut down power which slowed down the whole laptop. Also the seal was tampered one so I decided to file for a replacement.Amazon representatives were of no help even after 3 calls and conversation of several hours, finally 4 days later my replacement was confirmed. Until then the representative made sure that they tried every single trick on me to force me to keep the product and keep me stalling.Replacement arrived after 2 days of confirmation and the old one was picked up at the same time.Replaced Laptop: Screen bleeding or burn in not so sure of but it was present, screen upper whole part was yellow and the other than that the whole screen was white. Left side panel was not fitting properly and something was coming out of it, keyboard was hit and miss, it sometimes did not took input.As it was a replacement, asking amazon to take it back was not going to be possible as I had seen how they were acting when they had to send in a replacement. Went ahead and filed a complain with hp, they sent an engineer who checked out the laprop and to his surprise the laptop&#39;s hard disk lock was broke which caused improper fitting of panel and thing poppong out of panel. He was not able to diagnose what the issue was with the panel but it was surely visible and even he was confused. The keyboard issue was also detected and he asked me what would I like, a replacement or a repair.As my return window with amazon was available and also hp has 11 days replacement option, I went ahead for replacement, to which I was provided a doa letter which I had to send to amazon and procure a replacement.I went ahead called up amazon, to my surprise the guy was hellbent to send an amazon technical representative at my place to diagnose the laptop, even though hp&#39;s own engineer had already carried it out, well location was not in their covered facility due to which they finally asked me what I want and I went for return as replacement for the third time was just illogical.My money was refunded, and to those who are willing to buy it, let me shed some light on another issue:Laptop Price that I had paid Rs50990HP&#39;s MRP Rs59990 upon hp&#39;s discount at store or online store you will end up paying from 55k to 56k.But as I bought the laptop from another online retailer other than their own website or local resellers, it was not eligible for hp&#39;s offers that can get you 1st year adp with 2 year extended warranty for Rs999. I was forced to shell out Rs6999 which will get me only 2 years extended warranty nothing else.So the lesson i learnt was buy products from exclusive partners where you can get offers, or else you will end up shelling out more money for the same thing.I am attaching video where you can see how the fan caused the cpu to drop down speed from 100mbps to 4mbps and photos wjere you can see faulty replacement for your reference.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Everything is good, but the laptop bag was not given by you, for which I am disatisfied. A laptop bag is an essential accessory along with a laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Absolutely crap at gaming. Nvidia doesn&#39;t help at all.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great design with pavilion x360 mode. Well managed for tablet view. Sound quality is great. All i needed a better battery backup for long time Play back for video and game. Performance is good with win10. Thanks to HP for this and amazon for timely delivery.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good laptop. Battery life could have been better. Style and look is awesome. Best performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great display and handy.  Its just an i3 so not for gaming.  Good for all normal use.  Streaming, movies,  browing and making presentations.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice product but screen display need improvement.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Except battery life, it is worth for every penny\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Well built product\n&#39;,
 &#39;This laptop is true package of all the needs a laptop can fulfill.The SSD in it is fast.. Though not very fast. 1 Tb Hard Disk along with it provides ample storage.The display is amazing. Its damn crisp.Battery life (have not tested a lot) but should last about 4 hrs.Average Gaming can be done.. Although heat can be an issue over prolonged periods of gaming.The keyboard is nice and clicky..The backlight is bright enough for dark environment.The Speakers.. Man these are the best i have ever heard in a laptop. They are tremendously loud and clear.Overall feel of it is great.. Its light and sleek.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is gud in this price range but the best thing is its sound quality.I buyed it from Hp exclusive showroom with only 61,000 and with a original hp bag.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It is a very good product at this price range.I bought  it from  an hp exclusive store  @61000.It really comes with HP trendsetter backpack but I got HP odessy backpack!(online price is  a liitle high, better to go for hp offline  store and I think online sellers don&#39;t provide bag with it)It comes with genuine windows 10 and ms office with licenceIt throttle from 3.8ghz to 2.3ghz in heavy use(max-69degree C).Its just fine,works like a charmIt is really handy it&#39;s only 1.8kg thin and sleek.Sound is loud and clear.And in case of looks it is the best in my opinionComes with an nvme with read speed of 1500mb and write speed of 600mb.It is really fast but not as fast as  samsung evo nvme,but its good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;during  installing auto cad software one time no create problem but uninstall and again installing face big problem and my laptop screen white during restart my laptop but now working properly no any bugsGood laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Have been using from past 3 months no issues yet. It works well while running multiple simulations without any heating issues. Love the keyboard light.\n&#39;,
 &#39;good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t have the screen flickering problem unlike cs1000tx. Contains 256GB SSD at this price which is astonishing. Sound quality is awesome. The new hinge mechanism is the best part. The screen frame has a small error but its absolutely fine. Bought it from HP store @63000 and got a bag free\n&#34;,
 &#39;This model is selling in Chandigarh market around 57000/- in INR., Besides this, One can get 10 % cashback  on card also .It is not a gaming laptop,\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is the best laptop for everyone, all type of work you can do by it, if you are engineering student it is best for you,Pros -Best speaker in the laptopBoot time 10secSsd read 1700mb/s and write 700mb/sMx 250 for normal gamingAwesome look and feel due to matellic finishBattery life 5-6 hour in normal usageCons -Display is good but Viewing angle is not so good, but it is okayI got it in 60500 from hp store\n&#39;,
 &#34;Who wins the race for best ultrabook? Dell XPS 13 9370 or HP Spectre x360? For me HP was the answer :)If you are like me and stuck between a budget of 1.3L to 1.5L, go with this laptop. Already Dell India is not selling Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and also normal 9370 is costly af ranging around 1.45L. With exchange I just paid 3k more and got much better deal and much better configurations with this product. (Saved 35k)First of all the laptop&#39;s a beaut. Maybe the most gorgeous laptop in most gorgeous packing I&#39;ve ever seen. The UHD display with Nvidia graphics just blew my mind. Sound quality is awesome and gives a full surround feeling. Although I would say I&#39;m little disappointed with the battery life and keyboard feedback. Also this deal doesn&#39;t include thunderbolt to USB 3.0 and ethernet dongles so that&#39;s a let down too.But in summary - Beast of a laptop with high discount. Trust me, you won&#39;t get a better deal anywhere (I&#39;ve searched online and offline both).\n&#34;,
 &#39;Beast has a new Name. For all those who are in doubt that this laptop is not covered in India for warranty purpose, go ahead and buy it. I got my laptop on May 18th &amp; verified with HP customer care that its warranty is covered in India. For people who value quality over price, this is the best laptop which money can buy in India.Touch: marvelousDisplay: amazingKeyboard: ComfortableWifi: perfectSpeakers: had a minor issue within 10 days of purchase but since i am a music buff i complained to HP online customer support via chat.they sent a technician and replaced the speakers.360 rotation: awesomeThis is a laptop which can pay its price back within 2-3 months ( if your work involves a laptop ). It\&#39;s something which can be called &#34;Your Pride, and reason for Neighbours jealousy.For those who are considering to going for Dell 4K display laptop ( same config ), DONT. Dell has the webcam at bottom of the screen for its 4K display laptop. Looks weird &amp; stupid during Online meetings.Conclusion: I am really thankful to Amazon for this amazing laptop at great price. It is a no-brainer. If you have the money go for it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Can u please give me the key for my anti virus. For my mc afee. Product is real good.hope the pen could have been more responsive\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazing laptop but poor delivery quality.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The design is fantastic, the colour scheme as well, works smoothly. The technology is top notch, that’s clear to see. But what leaves something to b desired is the active stylus. The lag makes it tedious to use\n&#39;,
 &#39;Happy with the product but keep getting significant electric shock if I so much as touch the laptop while it is chargingStrange experience, never had this issue with any other computer\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent Premium Laptop to Buy...Every Tech Savvy Person Wont Miss a chance to Compliment its Look and Tech Specification\n&#39;,
 &#34;I am having issue with performance. it&#39;s too slow for 8 gb.and gets stuck with menu or chrome sometimes...I need to replace or repair it.how can I get a help.\n&#34;,
 &#39;All good, fan noise is too much\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its not have DVD driver\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen flickering at refresh rate 60htz, works fine at 40 htz. resolved delete intel graphic new version and download previous version. No flickering till now.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice laptop for professional use but if u are buying this then please add ssd in this for buttery smooth experienceBattery life is good enough and the best you will get the after sale service by HP.\n&#39;,
 &#34;My uncle had bought this laptop and this laptop is gaming but have professional look. It&#39;s outer pad is so smooth and scratchless . Each and every game whether GTA 5 works very smoothly on this laptop .\n&#34;,

 &#39;Main problem is...kindly mention in the product menu that AMAZON not give any CD/ PENDRIVE for laptop installation. The buyer should go to CSC centre and after paying 1000 Ra they are installing the software . Discount no use\n&#39;,
 &#34;It is a good average device,but it has slow processor.Most Important:It support only Win 10 64bit,other operating system&#39;s drivers are not available even on the official website of HP.I have checked the device with Win 7 and almost every function was not even available like I was not able to connect my PD,phone etc.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Not good built quality .. performance not good .very slow.Built quality is very very poor\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s awesome and everything was great budget laptops are the best for office purposes\n&#34;,
 &#39;over all good but after format with win 7 this laptop may required drivers. driver cd not received with laptop\n&#39;,

 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;For 40k bucks you can not beat this deal. I haven&#39;t even installed the ssd yet. Running off the original hard drive. Works perfect. Little slow to load windows, but wakes from sleep in a second. Computer runs perfectly smooth. I have 2 monitors connected hdmi and vga ports, no problem whatsoever. (3 screens simultaneously with no problem) When I see bad reviews I guess they got a lemon or they are expecting too much. As for bad reviews with software problems, well that sounds like computer illiterates and has nothing to do with the quality of the computer. Great deal, do not think it can be beat. Only downside is no backlit keyboard.Also, Get 10% Cashback on this or Any Laptop by Ordering through vqr.in/80.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Using it from last 10 days ... Working really well ... install windows and enjoy .. very good for my video editing ... Gaming ... Battery back up 3-6 hours depends on your works and settings ... Very good build quality... Keys are very good quality... Well packaging... Safe delivery... But seller didnt respond my questions.. otherwise everything is fine ... You can definitely go for this one .. 👍👍👍👍👍\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product..Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Perfomances is very good ..no issue till now ..Only Six Months warranty Remaining ..I called amazon customer care for warranty issue ..he said that it is hp warranty issue. E cant do anything..very disappointing\n&#39;,
 &#34;this pc comes with doc os but after buy this you can add your own os  best laptop for daily purpose . what is the thing  i did&#39;ntlike in this pc is keyboard style and does have backlight keyboard. overall pc is good\n&#34;,
 &#39;Received brand new laptop.But there was no Wifi card...installed all driver to activate and but all efforts were useless..Later I purchased the same laptop with other seller and that system was upto the mark.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is as expected to be working smooth,If anyone wants to buy also callme 9867050517, I am selling mine too\n&#39;,
 &#39;OVERALL GOOD PRODUCT GO WITH THIS PRODUCT SCREEN QUALITY NOT UPTO MARK\n&#39;,
 &#39;It has a decent battery, good sound, good display and fast enough for daily use\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros: is stylish, has long batter life, responsive stylus pen, good configuration.Cons: hangs sometimes, bad build quality with respect to material used in body, bad online support for this laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery life is poor. Not as per expectation\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is nice, built quality is awesome. Battery backup is average. Sound quality is good but not so loud, B&amp;O fails over here. Rest performance wise this laptop is beast, superb performance. Easy to carry, you can buy without any hesitation.Bought it from local store for 90k only🙂\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice pc...no heating issue...no lag in run... Very smooth performance...buid quality is awesome...sound system is not so loud but sufficient... battery backup is upto 6 hours approx...if you want to purchase it ...go offline on your nearest Store...buy it without any hesitation... when it comes to performance...it  is very nice pc...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wasting of money like simply throwing in fire.worst quality and worst support from hp\n&#39;,
 &#39;Beautiful finish but there are some scratches along the edges.. The packing was really good.. No one could ever feel whats inside.. Oh also, the package weighted perfectly fine too.. Thanks #Amazon.. 👍🙂\n&#39;,
 &#39;Okay\n&#39;,
 &#34;Well i was looking for a laptop within a budget of 30K. Once you carefully compare the lineup HP and Asus are the clear contenders in this category (Lenovo i don&#39;t trust ever since the Superfish incident and because of their terrible displays). The asus X555 LA&#39;s are fantastic overall but the major draw back would be the inbuilt battery. Laptop longevity dictates that you have removable batteries for later replacement which won&#39;t be an option!Reasons why I chose the 250 G5:1. DDR4 2133 Ram: the latet and the fastest category2. The i3 6006u is one of the best budget to mid level chips out there in terms of battery/performance. Its a 14nm chip and hence also the heat levels are non existent. The onboard Intel HD 520 is sufficient for up to 4k video playback. My personal use suggests that it plays even the GTA 5 in the mid graphics level. (If you are a gamer though you may consider the HP 15 with AMD A10 and dedicated graphics priced slightly higher)3. The Matte screen - as my work would involve a lot of reading and Office use a matte display is way better than the HP Brightview screens on competing models.4. Build - the G5 is built like a tank; the plastics overall are par with the price you pay5. After Sales: HP and Dell have the best after sales support in our part of the country.6. Bluetooth and Wifi: This model comes with the latest gen BLE 4.2 and Dual Band wifi - none of these are available on any other model at this price. My own surfing speed has gone up by 2mbps on an average.NOTE:1. The drivers are auto updated in Windows 10 - no extra hard work required. Its a Free Dos unit and you will have to install your own version of Windows 10. I went with the Win 10 PR0 64bit.2. No laptop carry bag is includedThings i wished were better:1. The display - like all TFT panels in up to 40k laptops this one doesnt win any awards. Its usable and functional with average viewing angles. Bear in mind i&#39;m comparing it to IPS panels which would cost atleast 50k and above. This won&#39;t hold a candle to my Dell S2440 Desktop Monitor which has a SHARP IPS panel.2. The trackpad has a plasticky texture - i personally prefer the smooth trackpads of ASUS Laptops which are actually comparable to Macbooks. Though the HP trackpad is perfectly fine in daily use - i&#39;m nit picking here.Would recommend this laptop as the best model under 30 K.Cheers! :)\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is not 6th gen it is a 5th generationAlso in this laptop hard drive is 500 GBAmazon specification is wrong but laptop performance is good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;I needed a 14inch screen laptop with optical drive because i admire portabilty in every sense and this is exactly that. Battery life is upto 3hrs and could be more if you increase the power saver mode. It also charges quite quickly when plugged to electricity supply. I&#39;ve used it for morethan a month now and everything seem good so far. It is more like a notebook pc. It is of light weight Not even upto 2kg. I installed the windows myself though. Sound is relatively ok for its size\n&#34;,
 &#34;Brought one month back using also from one month daily one hour for only online class, one speaker is problem getting big sound unable to hear voice... don&#39;t buy this\n&#34;,
 &#39;i love it\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is the best\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall ok\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Making the fool of people. Showing heavy discount, due to increase the cost of products\n&#39;,
 &#39;overall performance is good.battery capacity is less than expected.I have upgraded the RAMproduct is working fine.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Plz do not purchase renewal because we have purchased and find out aero key not working and again and again windows blue print dump after sleep mode\n&#39;,
 &#39;economical\n&#39;,
 &#34;Not worth it. Don&#39;t go by the discount, it is an outdated device. Spend extra 10k-15k and get a better laptop than this outdated crap.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I want to make something clear. The people buying this laptop are not fools. They know Ultrabooks exist. At this price point Ultrabooks are normal.ButPeople who are suffocating with Windows for a decade and half and unable to shift to the &#34;fruit&#34; for practical reasons, this device is a boon. And truly a glimpse of future.An offline capable Chromebook with whole play store to choose from.For everyday office works to high end gaming and internet browsing is a breeze.A very light OS, with Intel 8th gen board and 8GB RAM,= Scary fast performance.Superb build quality. Premium finish. Solid feel, no creaks.Dedicated volume keys.Seamless updatesSeamless syncSeamlessly connected, mobile, PC and TV.The heaven I was waiting for.Oh. And the sound quality is GOOD.You cant expect 5.1 surround sound from a 1 cm thick laptop.But sound is that good, that in a quiet room, you do not need headphones or speakers.No cons till now.Wait for price drop if you can. I was impatient to buy it.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Sells for peanuts abroad. Get a Zenbook/Vivobook/LgGram/whatever if you are spending so much on a light notebook (this isn&#39;t even light at 1.6kg!).\n&#34;,
 &#39;Getting used to apps on my phone, this was a product I was waiting for, it is super fast and with Chrome OS, there is no chance of a Virus in my system. An excellent device for my personal use\n&#39;,
 &#39;For Chromebook lovers.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Loved it\n&#39;,
 &#34;Hardware :I would highly suggests others to not buy this laptop at this price point. Chrome OS have very limited use cases and with 64 GB of eMMC storage it&#39;s even worse. A 50k+ laptop with 64 GB eMMC storage. Are you fooling Indian customers? For those who don&#39;t know eMMC is just like phone SD cards and they are not fast like typical SSDs (like Samsung or Intel SSDs). Only reason why this computer boots faster than say a Windows laptop of similar specs is because of Chrome OS. Although the screen on this is actually good IPS but I can&#39;t comment on actual quality though. Other specs are also good 8GB Ram and i5 CPU.Chrome OS : Chrome OS is a Linux distribution made by Google which is just a glorified Chrome browser with somewhat Android App support. The idea is that most people use there computers for browsing only so a chrome browser would be sufficient. It makes the OS fast and lot more secure than full fledge OS like Windows.The problem is that Chrome OS is very limiting for a student. I as a student use many more software other than Google Chrome on a daily basis. You may argue that Android apps are replacement for those applications but that&#39;s not the case.I can&#39;t compare Microsoft Office 2019 to the android version of Microsoft Office. Things get even worse for other specialized softwares like coding, engineering, image editing, video editing etc.Overall Verdict:Don&#39;t buy this laptop. It won&#39;t be useful for students, businessmen, or anyone for that matter. You can get i5 CPU, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD (actual ssd not fake eMMC drive) for even less than this (look for Asus).It maybe only useful for some niche catagory who wants a laptop to check email and browse web or watch movies only but again 64 GB storage is very limited to store movies and you would have a better experience with Windows 10.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is expensive i can buy a notebook in the same price\n&#39;,
 &#39;very High price for this specification.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Edit on 20/9/19: fingerprint scanner wont work if you don&#39;t update windows. So keep windows always updated. Once windows is updated time to time, the fingerprint scanner works like lightning!!Pros:1. Fast bootup since windows drive is on the ssd2. Responsive fingerprint and touch input.3. Responsive pen input (but microsoft whiteboard app better than sketchpad)5. Good speakers by Bang and Olufsen. Doesnt treble much at max volume.6. 2gb GPU by nvidia does a decent job. Running DmC devil may cry, bayonetta, nfs most wanted 2012, metal gear rising, devil may cry 4 SE at medium settings.7. Charges quite fastCons:1. Battery life is poor. Max 5-6 hrs2. 4 gb ram only. At this price was expecting 8gb ram.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Overall product quality is good. Value for money. Battery life is also good for moderate to intense use.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I think battery backup is no longer\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best for carrying and multitasking.\n&#39;,
 &#39;DEFECTIVE PRODUCT\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;The pen is a part of the product description as well as the invoice but not delivered.\n&#39;,
 &#39;fine\n&#39;,
 &#34;I am an electrical and electronics engineer and started using computers from 1984 onward. This might have been my 8th or 9th laptop since 2004. The product was delivered on 9th Nov 2018, but the accessories like screen guard were delivered on 14 Nov only. I opened the pack only after that. Took few days to install the required programmes. The first full day use was on 21 Nov and by afternoon, the laptop began to heat up at an unbelievable rate. The fan is running at high speed but that portion is so hot that you will not be able to touch it. When complained Amazon flatly refused replacement ( since this issue happened on 11 th day of purchase and they can take back if it is on 10th day) and asked to seek the warranty from the manufacturer. I am stuck with this product after paying about Rs 60000. Don&#39;t go near this product or seller or Amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;There is some problem with this laptop. Its sound will stop working after 10-15 day use probably due to some defective driver from hp. Once this happens, no matter what you do, the sound will  not work. Uninstall Install driver, troubleshoot by windows troubleshooter even restoring does not work. Visiting hp service center is actually a headache but that is the only option left now.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s been 2 weeks since it was delivered, 2 major problems have already occurred. First somehow the laptop won&#39;t open, I then have to fix it with the help of videosSecond problem was that suddenly it&#39;s audio drivers were not working then I had to reinstall them. Otherwise trackpad is good,sound is good, touchscreen is good, graphics is good\n&#34;,
 &#39;Pros :1. Durable, Excellent specifications2. SSD so it is super fast, comes with Microsoft XP office, Windows 10 and Mc Affee (1month valid only)3. Rose gold color is a plus4. The stylus is an additional plus point5. x360 and good hinge support gives many viewing angle options6. Battery life is ~ 3-4 hours7. It is heavier than the EliteBook version of HP8. Excellent packing and super fast delivery in 8 hours by Amazon.Cons :1. Double check the warranty of the product on HPE Website2. The warranty starts before the purchase hence need to be re-aligned or adjusted by producing the invoice3. None as of now\n&#39;,
 &#34;Review after 7 hours  of delivery: (will update after few days of usage)1.Got at the price of 55490Rs/-.2.Touch is good, tablet mode is also good.3.Fast boot due to SSD.4.Backlit key board is Good.5. Sound is good.6.No heating issues.7.Charging is quick and lasts long(Haven&#39;t checked explicit timings)8. Can Plays 4K videos on two-three tabs at a time without any lag.9.No problem with wifi, Bluetooth, USB ports, etc.Cons:1. HP warranty is shown as only 4 months after registering product at HP website, Solved by contacting HP customer care and Warranty increased to 1 year.2.Fan was noisy at start due to heat, after updating bios and few windows 10 required updates and changing few startup settings, this issue is solved.Overall a above average touch, SSD 8GB Laptop at the price range of 54K-56K\n&#34;,
 &#39;Continuous Yellow tint/hue on laptop screen display, instead of being a normal white display. Even movies played, photos and apps are shown with a yellow hue.Tried colour callibration in colour management, nothing works.It could be that laptop model itself could be faulty.Amazon laptop technician will come to inspect the item after 7 days, and provide his report, after which the product can be replaced.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought this laptop on 12th Oct... Within 2 weeks, audio went off due to defective driver update from HP. Since I didn’t had much data, restored it back to factory settings n issue resolved. After that, started getting BSOD every time I started my laptop. Reported to HP support, they refused to exchange as it was more than 15 days. L2 back and forth took 15 days before service center took the laptop. They reinstalled OS (without my permission) and I lost recovery plus the pre-loaded office 2016. Frustrated - never buying HP again\n&#39;,
 &#39;Got it through the Great India Festival discount at approx Rs 55K. It has exceeded my expectations. It is a brand new OEM box sealed product from HP and recognized as such for warranty. Fantastic delivery and pickup of old laptop, no much hassles despite the festive rush. Audio output is superb. The laptop looks and feels great, the screen is almost the size of a regular 15 inch one. Soft keypad, backlit, folds to a tablet 180 degrees. The stylus is great for free hand sketching and drawing. Mine is a 128 SSD model, is super light and portable. Ideal for students and professionals. Battery lasts almost 5 hours with moderate work. Great to watch videos on. In short, an ideal performance laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is sent with a Pen, two additional nibs which can be used to draw, take notes, or and immediately  convert to text.Using it for 6 months nowCons:* If improperly configured may give occasional hangup.* Touch is good but not as good as Surface pro or IPad* Lot of unwanted things must b gotten rid of for better performance.* A little bit of heat issues but managable.Pros* Comes with MS Office 2016 which is 15k iotherwise in Market.*Good Boot time hardly 1minute with minimal start menu and quick heal* battery has Ok life lasts 5 hours for normal office work(qua legal profession).* Pub g emulator works OK but 3 hours max Pug G battery life :)\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery back-up is lesser than mentioned in specifications.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Beautiful finish but there are some scratches along the edges.. The packing was really good.. No one could ever feel whats inside.. Oh also, the package weighted perfectly fine too.. Thanks #Amazon.. 👍🙂\n&#39;,
 &#39;Okay\n&#39;,
 &#34;Well i was looking for a laptop within a budget of 30K. Once you carefully compare the lineup HP and Asus are the clear contenders in this category (Lenovo i don&#39;t trust ever since the Superfish incident and because of their terrible displays). The asus X555 LA&#39;s are fantastic overall but the major draw back would be the inbuilt battery. Laptop longevity dictates that you have removable batteries for later replacement which won&#39;t be an option!Reasons why I chose the 250 G5:1. DDR4 2133 Ram: the latet and the fastest category2. The i3 6006u is one of the best budget to mid level chips out there in terms of battery/performance. Its a 14nm chip and hence also the heat levels are non existent. The onboard Intel HD 520 is sufficient for up to 4k video playback. My personal use suggests that it plays even the GTA 5 in the mid graphics level. (If you are a gamer though you may consider the HP 15 with AMD A10 and dedicated graphics priced slightly higher)3. The Matte screen - as my work would involve a lot of reading and Office use a matte display is way better than the HP Brightview screens on competing models.4. Build - the G5 is built like a tank; the plastics overall are par with the price you pay5. After Sales: HP and Dell have the best after sales support in our part of the country.6. Bluetooth and Wifi: This model comes with the latest gen BLE 4.2 and Dual Band wifi - none of these are available on any other model at this price. My own surfing speed has gone up by 2mbps on an average.NOTE:1. The drivers are auto updated in Windows 10 - no extra hard work required. Its a Free Dos unit and you will have to install your own version of Windows 10. I went with the Win 10 PR0 64bit.2. No laptop carry bag is includedThings i wished were better:1. The display - like all TFT panels in up to 40k laptops this one doesnt win any awards. Its usable and functional with average viewing angles. Bear in mind i&#39;m comparing it to IPS panels which would cost atleast 50k and above. This won&#39;t hold a candle to my Dell S2440 Desktop Monitor which has a SHARP IPS panel.2. The trackpad has a plasticky texture - i personally prefer the smooth trackpads of ASUS Laptops which are actually comparable to Macbooks. Though the HP trackpad is perfectly fine in daily use - i&#39;m nit picking here.Would recommend this laptop as the best model under 30 K.Cheers! :)\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is not 6th gen it is a 5th generationAlso in this laptop hard drive is 500 GBAmazon specification is wrong but laptop performance is good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,

 &#39;Very slow processor ,battery back up only good\n&#39;,
 &#34;System is very slow. Taking too much time to open any window. Sometime window stop responding. USB port is not good. Not value for money don&#39;t purchase it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Does the job of a normal user.\n&#39;,
 &#39;happy to buy this .... it’s performance is really unmatchable if used for office work\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worth just for price\n&#39;,
 &#39;the start button is not working. also the processing is very very slow. not at all good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very poor performance, processor is very very slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very bad product system is very very slwo and customer center is not responding properly\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;The hard disk started giving problems 45 days after purchase.  To get the any parts replaced after a month, there is an additional cost. The laptop has to be shipped to Delhi for this. The parts are unreliable. Best to not take a risk.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Super ram high quality laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;It Can run High Frequency Electromagnetic Simulation at basic level.\n&#39;,
 &#39;good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent\n&#39;,
 &#34;I purchased 4 gb RAM, 240 GB SSD along with this laptop. When it got delivered i tried to open it which was very complicated. Even after unscrew everything in back panel. Optical driver doesn&#39;t come outside and Yellow cable is still attached to Motherboard.Please advise its very urgent.Thanks\n&#34;,
 &#39;Packing is not good they have no kushans in  the box  Laptop is good at prize &amp; good display, sharp speaker\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good.  No issues so far (3 months).\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good Product at this price range, Long battery life. Overall Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Have been using it for past two months. Till now no issues. Installed a m.2 ssd hard drive and speed improved considerably.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t support Win 7. I had choose this product without OS because I want to install own OS, but it supports only Windows 10. That&#39;s why it is worthless\n&#34;,
 &#39;Perfect for daily use, i m using this from last one month and still not yet find any single issue.  battery backup is 5hr. and display quality is too good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This product is very low quality. Screen showing yellowish  and speed is also worst. It seems supplier supply duplicate product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;i Purchased on 25-01-2019, Warranty has to be for 1 year, HP Portal showing 9 Months only. Please check and extant\n&#39;,
 &#39;Powerful laptop.. everything is good. But battery backup should be more. Overall this laptop perform nicely\n&#39;,
 &#34;Do not buy worst laptop I&#39;ve ever purchase\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome Worth using\n&#39;,
 &#39;Working fine till now. But quiet expensive, Light product and quiet fast.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great with this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product .....Looking nice and very weight less fully made up of metal ...... Speed of process is hasum .\n&#39;,
 &#34;Review Unit: Intel Core i7-8565U (whiskey lake),16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, 1W UHD (1080p) touchscreen with HP SureView, Dark Ash Silver with Copper accentsNote: Review submitted after 46 days of using laptop as daily driverThe HP Spectre ×360 is by far one of the most sleep Ultrabooks on the market. It&#39;s only competitor is perhaps the Dell XPS 13.In this review, I will be drawing many comparisons with the aforementioned Dell XPS of similar specifications.-----Design (5/5): The very first sight of my new Ultrabook was enough to make me fall in love with it. This is by far the most visually appealing laptop there has ever been (unless you&#39;re into big fat laptops from the early 2000s, in which case, this is definitely not for you). The color of the unit, the &#39;gem cut&#39; design, the faceted corners, and pretty much everything about this laptop (including the luxurious, and thoughtful, packaging) screams premium.The Dell XPS has a rather elegant simplicity, but like most others, I would buy the HP Spectre just for its design. The side bezels are tiny, whereas the chin and upper bezels are relatively fat, which may give some a slightly aged impression. However, the extra bezel allows for a camera above the display (no nose cam like the 2017 XPS), one with Windows Hello IR facial recognition (which the its Dell counterpart doesn&#39;t have). Also, the same extra size on the keyboard deck allows for an extra speaker, which sounds beautiful (more on that later).Durability- The chassis is carved out of a single piece of aluminium, which makes for a very sturdy build. However, I did notice a good deal of flex on the screen, and on the keyboard deck. And after 45 days of usage, I realized that the right side of the keyboard deck was ever so slightly elevated, enough to wobble the screen when repeatedly pressed down.HP generally doesn&#39;t compare very well to Dell when it comes to build quality, but this laptop, being their most premium 13 incher, does fairly well in that domain.-----Port Selection (4/5): The ports on this device include 2 USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports, either of which can be used for charging (and one of which is placed on the right hand side chamfered corner), 1 USB A, a 3.5mm headphones jack, and a MicroSD card reader. As one can expect from a thin and light Ultrabook, there is no Optical reader on this device (nor is there an Ethernet cable port). This is great for legacy support, and at the same time, you can hook the laptop up to 2 4k monitors.-----Display (4/5): The display draws just 1W of power, which boosts its battery life by a good deal, as opposed to the general 2W displays. The shiny screen does accumulate a lot of fingerprints, as does the all metal body of the laptop, and can also be the source of some annoying glare. This problem is further compounded by a relatively low maximum brightness (again, owing to the low powered display), which may not be suitable for outdoor use (for dark, low contrast content like &#39;the Battle of Winterfell&#39;.This unit also comes with the HP SureView feature, which on activation by a simple function key, washes out the screen, drastically reducing the viewing angles. I didn&#39;t find myself using this feature very often, but the small lot of people using this laptop for business purposes may benefit from it in public areas. Also, the washed out screen resembles the feeling you get when you have migraines (thankfully, on a much more tolerable level), but it&#39;s still very much usable.The colors on the screen are vibrant, and even the closest details can be observed rather easily without even having to upgrade to the 4K screen (which is the 2W non sure view version, and also costs a little more). The blacks are deep enough to mistake for an OLED screen, which came as a relief to me, as I&#39;m obsessed with those.-----Sound (5/5): For buyers looking for a portable personal daily driver suitable for content consumption, if the display and design didn&#39;t do the trick, the sound will mesmerize you into buying it. Tuned by Bang &amp; Olufsen, these speakers get it just right when it comes to higher notes. The lows are very good, but as one can expect from such a thin laptop, they don&#39;t produce the deepest bass. But again, none of the laptops in this segment do.The Spectre&#39;s design fits in 4 speakers, such that no matter what orientation the 2-in-1 device is positioned in, a speaker is always firing towards the user, which provides for an always crisp audio output. This was one reason as to why I was actually disappointed when HP refreshed the design with smaller bezels, which resulted in the omission of the speakers above the keyboard.-----Battery (5/5): As HP advertises, this battery is a monster. Of course, claims of 22-23 hours of battery are nowhere near the actual time I get on one charge, but I do get about 10+ hours on medium to heavy usage including an IDE, heavy web surfing, and intermittent videos being played. This is thanks to the low powered display I mentioned earlier.-----Performance (4.5/5): This is probably the only category in which the Dell XPS may surpass the Spectre, which is not to say that the HP Spectre isn&#39;t powerful enough, though. The Spectre&#39;s fast quad core processor blew right past anything I threw at it. However, the fans did kick in pretty soon. Although they don&#39;t produce too much of a noise, and are slightly customizable in the HP Command Center, I guess that&#39;s one of the not so perks of having an all metal design. The top of the keyboard deck did get a little hot, being metallic, but it was nothing beyond the expected levels.As far as graphic processing is concerned, the Spectre ships with Intel&#39;s integrated UHD 620 graphics, which is adequate for content consumption, and maybe even some light video editing and gaming. But don&#39;t expect the Spectre to be put to studio use without getting very hot, very quickly.Toshiba&#39;s NVME SSD (the fastest kind) proved to be blazing quick, producing amazingly high read and write speeds. Intel&#39;s Gigabit WiFi (WiFi 6) card also proved to be very, very quick, which I could see when YouTube automatically chose HD video quality at points in the house where I&#39;d never before even been able to connect to the router, with older devices.-----Tablet Mode (4/5): As the name of the computer suggests, the hinge can rotate all of 360 degrees, enabling 4 different positions for you to use it in - Laptop mode, tablet mode, and the intermediary Tent and presentation modes. While the tablet and modes was really pleasant for content consumption, I found the presentation mode practically unusable, owing the the large amounts of screen wobble. This would probably be best suited for a long presentation or a large movie, where the laptop would just go untouched for a long time. The screen wobble was also too much to enjoy using the included HP Pen comfortably on laptop mode. I was also annoyed when Chrome didn&#39;t automatically open the on screen keyboard when I pressed the address bar (unless I used the pen). As with most other pens that come with convertible laptops, the HP Pen, although very smooth and useful (with 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity) felt rather heavy to use. I look forward to them getting lighter, before using this to take hand written notes, which I wouldn&#39;t do anyway, on a laptop.-----Keyboard (5/5): HP, as always, impressed me with their wonderful keyboard. I took little time to adjust to this beauty, which had great feedback with its ample 1.4mm of key travel, and we&#39;ll spaced Chiclet style keys, with 3 different levels of back lighting, which was also very uniform with no bleeding.-----Trackpad (4.5/5): The glass trackpad is very wide, and tall enough for my liking. Many complain about the lack of Precision drivers for the trackpad, but I don&#39;t understand the furore. There is obviously a difference between the existing Synaptics drivers and the Windows native Precision drivers, but the great hardware reduces the difference into almost unnoticeable. The trackpad was adequately responsive, and all of Windows&#39; multi finger gestures were supported, with the occasional, but never frustrating, hitch.----- Other Security Features: The Spectre also comes with a fingerprint reader connected right at THE BIOS level, which provides for a very secure method to log in to the device. However, the same results in the fingerprint reader being rather slow, painfully so at times. However, the facial recognition was really fast, and made up for it.In addition to the SureView display, HP also included a physical Webcam kill switch right below the USB C port on the right side, which when enabled, physically cuts power to the camera, and removes it at the BIOS level. This should provide some solace to you privacy freaks out there.----------The Verdict: 4.5/5The HP Spectre has long been my favorite laptop, but as with anything else under the sky, isn&#39;t perfect. I&#39;d recommend it to anyone who needs a fast laptop at home, or for general productivity tasks. The high speed SSD and the quick processor got me through everything without ever complaining about speed, other then when YouTube switched from full screen to normal, and vice versa, which took about a second, enough to not go unnoticed.While I would have really appreciated an OLED screen (which will be a part of the refreshed version as recently announced by HP), this got me through everything just as well.Value for Money: 4.5/5While I wouldn&#39;t say that the price tag (at the time of buying) isn&#39;t hefty, it sure is justified by the sheet quality and speed of the hardware and software components on the device. Add to that the convertible nature of the laptop, and you&#39;ve got yourself a bang for your buck.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Amazing laptop super stylish equally efficient.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worth every pennyA detailed review by another person above is vry true. Good perfomance. Good dat transfer speeds. Good design and body. Excellent battery life. Performance packed monster it is.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awsum...Metal protected lapi.... I am willing to purchase another one next year for my sister....Nice speed..Thanks hpAnd also speed delivery from flipi\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have got the laptop but it is not working.  The window is  not running.  This is a faulty laptop.  My advice is to never buy a renewable laptop.  My experience is very bad in this regard.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Windows does not start only never buy\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst product!!! Even replaced item is defective. Don&#39;t buy this\n&#34;,
 &#39;50 : 50\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product as described. Works well. Miss Optical Drive\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought this product a week ago and as expected, the speed is really very fast due to 8GB RAM, i5 Processor and SSD storage type.\n&#39;,
 &#34;So far working ok..they promise Free gift but don&#39;t send\n&#34;,
 &#34;Mouse pad doesn&#39;t work properly\n&#34;,
 &#34;The seller (Rentopcdotcom) offers very poor quality refurbished items. I purchased a laptop (HP Elitebook 840G1). The laptop had spurious parts and when asked about it, they don&#39;t respond. The RAM was unbranded and incorrect frequency (used 1033 Mhz instead of 1600 for this model). The charger was spurious and also had issues providing correct voltage. The screen had dead pixels but was still called certified refurbished. The only saving grace was the appearance which was not too bad. Hence please don&#39;t order high RAM and hard disk/ SSD config from these guys as they are spurious anyway. Please expect to spend more money on hard disk/ ssd, RAM, charger, battery. as all of these will be spurious . If sold for 20k levels, this becomes a bargain as we can easily change RAM and HDD by just taking off the user removable cover.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop is perfectly working but second battery is missing,  pls arrane to send on priority.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Was really bad.... And worst too. Because within 3 months so many problems occurred. Now I am still stuck.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is very unusable because I returned it so they said it does not replace or returned\n&#39;,
 &#34;The renewed laptop that was delivered was in a poor condition with scratches all over. There was even a small crack on the top of the lid. I was okay with all that after all it was a renewed one. But once I started using it realised the battery of the laptop wasn&#39;t in a good condition too. Can only be used when plugged in and turns off instantly when disconnected from the plug.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have received a worth product. The seller of the product is selling the finest and quality worth product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is good enough for basic requirement like net surfing, working on ms office and some  basic applications.  Though bit slow, but help you sail through your needs.its not for speed hungry people. Best for people looking for budget laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;overall good but slightly slow and battery backup disappointing meI got it 28000 in a good price rangestylish look\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good for day to day usage. But before you purchase check if the seller is an authorised reseller of HP otherwise you will have to face warranty issues related to the product. I have faced the same and after lot of phone calls &amp; email I was able to resolve the same.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Display super,Battery also good ,touch nd keypad have a very smooth,but I didn&#39;t received warranty\n&#34;,
 &#39;A good quality laptop with high performing  processor. Bettery life very satisfactory. No doubt one would get value for money.\n&#39;,

 &#39;Super\n&#39;,
 &#39;Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\&#39;t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&amp;O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed &amp; higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (&#34;HP assistant&#34; is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\&#39;t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop &amp; my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I was looking for a laptop that is:1. Two in one Laptop plus tablet that is 360 degree foldable but not detachable  and comes with a free pen2. Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don&#39;t do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t get everything at this price point.  It&#39;s about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a &#39;cool&#39; look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)\n&#34;,
 &#34;With premium fit and finish to go with all the features mentioned, this model is a good combination of both form and functionality. The only grouse was that there was some lag initially while booting up, but that seems to have gone away on its own now. Also, it&#39;s only been a few weeks since I&#39;ve been using it, so I can&#39;t speak for its durability. This particular piece is a replacement piece - the original one that was delivered refused to start! So am a little worried - my experience with HP products has been great in the past, so let&#39;s hope this one also continues to reinforce that.Also, Get 10% cb and 6 months extended warranty by ordering through wplov .in/63\n&#34;,
 &#34;I bought this product in a hurry during Diwali time and I regret almost daily. Below are a few but most critical issues I have faced ever since I bought this laptop1) Extremely slow and loading takes hell lot of time2) Though manual update is enabled system goes for auto windows update in every 2 days time. Updates runs for 6/7 hours which means you never get time to use the laptop3) No matter how many times you run shut down command the laptop continues to be on unless you physically shut it down4) can&#39;t even open 4 Window tabs simultaneously as it crashes5) Overall nice looking fancy gadget without any practical utilities..Extremely disappointing and hope I can get it replaced.\n&#34;,
 &#39;\xa0This laptop has an SSHD for boot up , so ideally it should be fast and smooth but sadly that is not at all the case , the apps crash and the laptop lags and becomes irresponsive as soon as you shift to tablet mode also it has a problem of over heating. All in all the performance is highly dissatisfactory. I have a Macbookpro that i bought in 2014 and even that works better than the new HP x360 that i got. Also , even after constant attempts Amazon has not yet helped me getting a refund or even a replacement for the product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought it less than 10 days ago. Got a faulty product. Very slow and hanging always. Overheating too in 5 min. Very disappointed with HP and Amazon. Need replacement!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Have been using this laptop for the last 3 months and the issues seem to never end. It looks good, feels good and there ends the matter. I am already facing issues with the audio, the company claims it to be a software update issue. The heat sink stopped working and it&#39;s been more than 15 days since the complaint has been raised yet they have to replace the part not sure of they are yet to manufacturer it. Pathetic after sales service. The laptop is slower than a P1 system. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Will update this review once the part is replaced to see if it improves the performance.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is an awesome laptop. It has premium look. And as some review mentioned it is a bit slow with 4 GB ram but once you upgrade it to 8GB it runs smoothly without any single lag. After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe&#39;s light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn&#39;t actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it&#39;s deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have purchased HP Pavilion x360 14 inch, What a fantastic machine it is!  Screen touch, booting speed is really extra ordinary\n&#39;,
 &#34;Battery life won&#39;t even standby for 3 hours, the machine is super slow you can&#39;t open up more than four tabs in the browser. Any applications startup seems very slow very disappointed, deceived by the looks 😣\n&#34;,
 &#39;The pen is a part of the product description as well as the invoice but not delivered.\n&#39;,
 &#39;fine\n&#39;,
 &#34;The product is Good. And its great value for money. But I recommend to everyone if you can get more upgraded version of GeForce and higher clock at the same or nearly the same or within a litlle price difference then that vl be best for you. I vl add one thing that don&#39;t expect too much from the battery backup. You need to keep charger plugged while using it.Now coming to my concern. I bought this laptop in March 2019. After I checked the warranty online it was expired. I contacted HP customer care and the asked me for P-slip on which the serial no. of the product was written. I downloaded my P-slip and the serial no. written on it was different than that of my Laptop. I contacted Amazon for this and 1st they told me to wait for 24 hrs. After then nothing happened and now it has been almost 3 months and they still haven&#39;t solved my issue. Every time I contact Amazon they ask me to wait for 4-6 working days. And after that nothing happens and then when I contact them again they repeat the same thing. I fon&#39;t understand why amazon is so careless about my issue. Maybe they have given me the used product instead of real one thats why the serial no. is different and they are not changing it. I don&#39;t know what to do. They have already wasted my 3 months and also of warranty too. I also tweeted about my problem and tagged Amazon but they didn&#39;t respond. So, I recommend everybody not to shop from their site you can get the same laptop from Flipkart or other site also. Thats it...\n&#34;,
 &#39;It has a flickering issue.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Buy it. But it will be great to have another 4gb added to the existing 4gb ram. But don&#39;t compromise by not buying this one, it&#39;s worth it!\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome laptopGo for itValue of your moneyAdd 4 GB ram extra for best performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best Product...\n&#39;,
 &#39;All r good\n&#39;,
 &#39;So used this machine for 1-2 week but faced flickering issue in display using phone nearby is causing this problem(specially the BAR phone)Performance- awesome 10/10GPU-Awesome(played Rainbow Six in High Settings9/10Best For video Editingand Gaming because it has 4GB of Nvidia GPUEverything is fine but i will update this review after receiving DOA(Replacement Product)So Please Crosscheck Your PC to.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s hanging and screen is flickering and it&#39;s annoying, worst product by hp\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s hanging and screen is flickering\n&#34;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;This product is not successful\n&#39;,
 &#34;I ordered 840 G2 on april-2019. Delivery time was quite faster.Mainly I am using this laptop for coding, 840 G2 is best for programming.While ordering a refurbished laptop I was very confused about the product,it&#39;s condition and the service. But I am pretty much satisfied with the product and the services by rentopc.com.Recently my product key got expired. And I contacted  Teena from rentopc , and they solved they issue through a remote session.I am happy and confident to recommend refurbished laptop from rentopc.\n&#34;,

 &#39;Talking about the product,Elitebook series are mainly built for professionals. This means that it is light weight, slim and 14 inch screen. And this was perfect for me.Apart from that, SSD hard disk makes it very fast in terms of data fetching and it has a decent battery backup.The processor is also a relatively newer version with 8 GB RAM.So, all in all, this is a good value for money.Coming to seller, the seller has done an excellent job in making sure that laptop looks new both in terms of look and performance. The laptop is running very smoothly. In addition to this, the support was very prompt from the seller.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best is class\n&#39;,
 &#39;The overall quality is good, only that the details of seller is not provided to us after the purchase and thus no details regarding warranty or any further doubts regarding the product is unavailable.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The performance is good enough.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have received laptop without window and dos update there is no software disk and no lucence its a great mistcake to puchage that material\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not satisfied by this laptop , worthless product, and after purchasing this product.  Amazon applications shows the date of returning laptop 10 days but, after 8 day returns policy and return window is closed...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice products\n&#39;,
 &#39;This one is a commercial series laptop ,equipped for long hours working...I Bought it for 22k after cash back and offer redemption...Any day better Deal...Thanks to seller and Amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Sold by a third party seller, not authorised by HP. The seller conveniently chose to not give the HP Active pen that comes with the laptop (given by the manufacturers itself) and the warranty period had begun 3 months before the purchase of the laptop itself. In all, it was the worst experience I had in purchasing a laptop from Amazon, who have also started encouraging third party sellers like eBay.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Personally I prefer it looks slimy, light weight but we have to use laptop as like laptop, screen touch is very delicate if any service comes it takes more than 10k, buy the laptop as like laptop feature\n&#39;,
 &#39;You will love it. Stylish, feel premium, product comes in a sealed package.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Totally worth it. And best laptop !\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best for student\n&#39;,
 &#39;amazing laptop from HP good performance touch display and keyboard, ordered from Amazon but could not received any offers from HP because of no authorize seller list on amazon seller list and battery backup is not good...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Interesting versatile laptop with pen support and pen as well. Been a few months since using it, no issues so far.\n&#39;,
 &#39;laptop looks really amazing like a MacBook.. problems are the battery life is less and it lags a bit... but other than these its awesome..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent laptop. Great screen display, speed awesome, sleek, light weight. Value for money.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased From Hp Outlet.....Laptop Is awesome... i think only one disadvantage High Perfomance application open  fan sound highr...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Making the fool of people. Showing heavy discount, due to increase the cost of products\n&#39;,
 &#39;overall performance is good.battery capacity is less than expected.I have upgraded the RAMproduct is working fine.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Plz do not purchase renewal because we have purchased and find out aero key not working and again and again windows blue print dump after sleep mode\n&#39;,
 &#39;economical\n&#39;,
 &#34;Not worth it. Don&#39;t go by the discount, it is an outdated device. Spend extra 10k-15k and get a better laptop than this outdated crap.\n&#34;,
 &#34;First off, I planned to use this laptop for occasional gaming (Witcher, Fallout etc), taking handwritten notes on oneNote, general purpose, and some programming. It fulfills all of these purposes extremely well.Pros:1. Boots up in seconds thanks to the SSD. So, you can take notes instantly.2. Can write and draw with the included pen without problems, and with palm rejection.3. Nice speakers and screen4. Lightweight5. Can run Witcher 3 at high settings with ~30fps6. ~8 hours of batteryPrecautions:1. The battery for the pen is AAAA and is expensive.2. Heats. So, don&#39;t forget to buy a good cooling pad.3. No LAN port and optical drive. So, if you need these, you&#39;ll have to buy the LAN-USB cable and the external optical drive.4. The WiFi adaptor turns itself off now and then. I had to restart the laptop for it to show again. Probably a software issue and am working on it.5. Cortana is shit compared to Google&#39;s assistantFor me, this was the best deal at any price range. It&#39;s the best compromise between mobility, raw power, and touchscreen features.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Pro&#39;s :1. Sleek design and colour gives premium look.2. Touch is very smooth &amp; delicate.3. With SSD, booting is fast.4. I use heavy softwares, so it works perfectly fine with it.5. Fingerprint6. Complete fold gives a premium tablet look.7. 14 inch size, so easy to carry.8. HP pen is a plus, for making notes.9. Speakers are good.Con&#39;s :1. Little bit heavier due to metallic body.2. With high usage, battery backup is almost 2.5-3 hours.3. Gets heated too, so buy a coolpad.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The product I received is samll and good for a student easy to carry and fast enough to do all of your work s  fine enough\n&#39;,
 &#34;NOTE: Once you Buy you wouldn&#39;t get refund. Amazon has an only Replacement policy for Laptops even if there is genuine problem !!The display of this laptop is very BAD !! It is yellowish in color. White would look yellowish. There were LED backlighting spots at the bottom of the display.Though it says 1080 resolution (full HD) - The quality is not up to the mark. I compared this with my other Full HD laptops, in this laptop resolution is poor !! An HD video doesn&#39;t look HD on the screenOther configurations were all good. But the DISPLAY is a big disappointment !! For a Laptop of 1Lacs this was shocking to me. Even a 15K laptop has better display than this one.There would be heating and fan sound on top of the BAD display issueIn short - don&#39;t invest 1L on this laptop. Not worthit\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is my first convertible, and my first laptop as well. So far I&#39;ve had a great experience with the laptop. It is quick to launch, a reasonably great feedback on touch, and quite good build quality that makes it feel premium and long lasting. Converting the laptop into a tablet is a joy. The addition of pen that allows for pressure sensitive sketching/painting was a welcome decision and fostered a new hobby.Here&#39;s a quick rundown on the good/bad:The display being IPS has great viewing angles, but not the best brightness. Reasonably good.The keyboard is not as clicky as I&#39;d have preferred, but still better than some other laptops I&#39;ve tried.The touchpad could be bigger.The I/O choices are pretty great.The i7 is pretty fast for daily use as well as the occasional simulations I run on it.The battery has lasted pretty long in my experience, however, keeping it on performance mode usually kills it pretty quickly. The best batter life mode is what I always use, and thats pretty good.Charges quite quickly. (around an hour usually. 2 at max)Not heavy for normal use.The fan gets noisy during regular use when being used for a long time. Nothing deal breaking though.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Specification is very well chosen aa per the current available technology by the hp team which is commendable\n&#39;,
 &#34;This is a decent Laptop for moderate usage and has pretty catching looks as well. Overall it performs decently for average purposes. However if use it for demanding activities, then it starts becoming a room heater.Some obvious observations:-----------------------------------------Noted Problems:1. The display has an ugly yellow tint.2.  Keyboard back-light is completely manual. It does not have an automatic timeout that enables the light to go off after 5 seconds of inactivity. Hence it consumes more battery. Also, there is no brightness adjustment for the same.3. Some heating issues, when processor demand is high4. Battery running out quite fast 3 - 4 hrs max against promised 11 hrs.5. The active pen doesn&#39;t have a power button, so it is perpetually turned on, reducing the battery life. This becomes a pain, considering that AAAA batteries are exorbitantly priced (~INR. 900)6. Keyboard feel is not so plush, feels nothing great for an INR. 100K Laptop.7. Overall sturdiness is less compared to Dell Latitude series models8. Poor quality camera in place of Full HD Webcam as per specs9. The touchpad could have been better, no button on touchpad design is not great. Also, there&#39;s no trackpad/stick10. Indicator lights (power and HDD) LED&#39;s are located on the sides is not a good design, as we have to lean over to see if it is on or off.11. Same is the case with the fingerprint reader, which is located on the side. Could have been way better if it was in the face area itself below the keyboard.12. No Number keypad embedded or no number lock for the keyboard.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good : Touch Screen, Display and convertable optionThings to improve: Battery\n&#39;,
 &#34;A good handy and powerful laptop. It&#39;s modern and very portable. Must say, it&#39;s money worth spent.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The warranty of the product when checked on the HP website shows 7 months , where as as per the terms it has to carry 12 months of warranty.I have written a mail to the seller but have not got a response.\n&#39;,
 &#39;\xa0Best\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best at the price. Looks are also goodAnd specs are best for the priceWell done HP Omen !\n&#39;,
 &#39;The price is very high but it is worth the money. If you try to build I pc with the same specs in India then it is going to be just a few thousand rupees less costly. Otherwise very good. Can play AAA titles like gta5 or the crew 2 at ultra settings at 50 fps on native resolution\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is king of computers in the world. This is best than MacBook.just go for it and get nice experience\n&#39;,
 &#39;My kidneys were better than this laptop 🥺\n&#39;,
 &#39;Buy a ps4 pro...thank me later\n&#39;,
 &#34;U all don&#39;t know pc or loptop graphic\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is my dream which I don&#39;t know when will be completed!\n&#34;,
 &#39;Get a ps4 pro or xbox one x instead.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Buy ps4 rather than this\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a great machine for everything that I do. It boots up quickly and is blindingly fast. I use it for Office, Internet, Ebay, and photo work and it is great.

 &#39;A new laptop slow very even cant open browser correctly . My old i3 is much better than this . Toatal money wastage .\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is too good 😍but I&#39;m disappointed on display 😑Battery 5/5Speak 5/5Display 4/5Other 5/5\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is Best laptop but  drawback the colour is silver total laptop and keyboard and there is no backlit keyboard\n&#39;,
 &#39;Talking about looks... Silver color looks great than black...Performance as it has 4gb ram...its bit slow and cannot perform more multitasking and programming in this..bit irritates us..People who intrested in normally playing games font buy this... Frustrating in gaming performance...Battery life good...Overall its good.. Better to buy for office and normal usages...\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is for multitasking and daily use . It is not for gaming purpose although you can play normal medium quality graphics game. You can upgrade ram to 8 gb for more effective performance.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is good for normal use good screen and battery life. Purchase it offline. 200 Rs cheaper.Got it for 43500.nice product. And silver colour is more beautiful than black\n&#39;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t buy it , I am crying after buying it. An ultra slow laptop. I bought it from store.\n&#34;,
 &#39;worst laptop\n&#39;,
 &#34;Nice laptop.. initially it was slow but after all the window updates it&#39;s working fine.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its a great laptop and below are the actual specsAgain it does not have 12 gb it has only 8 gb ram2 slots --- first 4 gb is onboarded ( cant remove)  Second slot has 4 gb ..* full hd* lift hinge design* 8 gb ddr4 ram* 1 tb 5400 hdd* 2 gb nvdia gpu* 14 inch display* i5 8th gen 8250u processor\n&#39;,
 &#34;purchased this device from an HP store for 63K. The device is made of using a combination of metal and plastic. The left side of the device always remains cool whereas the right side sometimes heats up as that&#39;s where the processor is located. The device was initially running a little slow and i was disappointed but once all the windows updates and drivers were installed everything changed and it&#39;s blazing fast now.The battery life is good and I get around 4 maybe 5 hours ( if you&#39;re listening to music+watching videos and surfing the web). You can easily get 9-10 hours out of it if you&#39;re using it to type up documents or make presentations with light browsing.Changing my review from 5 starts to 4 stars because watching movies on this device is incredibly hard. The screen is very reflective and I&#39;m looking at my own reflection half the time.RAM is 8GB not 12GB.Update after 2 months of usage-Battery life is still great, no lagging or slow down that is noticeable. only difference since the day i got it is that it takes maybe a couple of seconds longer to boot-up. even of low power mode + power savings enabled the devices breezes through most tasks effectively. I would also recommend users to actually make use of the windows 10 built in apps as compared to their alternatives as they appear to work better ( Microsoft edge, photos, groove music etc)&lt;&lt;random piece of advise. just in case you have a lot of  duplicate files use this free app called CloneSpy to get rid of any duplicates. helped me get rid of around 5gb in duplicate music files.&gt;&gt;\n&#34;,
 &#34;Look of this laptop is good or great it&#39;s a personal choice for me it&#39;s great.Display is FHD and for me it&#39;s good ( no bleeding issue )For how it works - u can guess that by it&#39;s configuration. ( I use this for simple browsing )Webcam is in b/w average to good.Typing experience is okaybattery - I got around little more then 3 hours in normal browsing with 50% brightness.Audio quality is good.But the problem which I found while using this laptop is it&#39;s touchpad.  Whole touch pad and right and left click are not separate so whole touch pad shake when u click . Else touch pad is not that responsive.Suggestion - u should check it&#39;s ports before buying this laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;\xa0I finally decided to buy this during the republic day sale and got it delivered yesterday (22 Jan2018) as i am a prime member. The spec is really good for this price and the asthetics of the laptop is very pleasing however i was shocked to realize that there is a manufacturing defect in the trackpad.The trackpad is not fixed properly to the frame, when i tap it slightly on the bottom centre or edges i can clearly see it moving up down and if i raise the laptop to my eye level i can see the trackpad is bulged out from the frame on the centre. I have raised this issue with amazon&#39;s technical team, i have sent them a short video of the problem and they have acknowledged that its a defect. Also i am very surprised as i don&#39;t understand how did this particular piece passed HP&#39;s quality checks.Finally got refund from amazon as the seller doesn&#39;t have any more stock left. A special appreciation for amazon.in technical team for promptly addressing this issue, I am changing my review to 4 star for support from amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome laptop happy to buy..!!\n&#39;,
 &#39;I had purchased one from the HP store and it was having tremendous heating issue. The engineer from HP came to check and discovered that the HDD is heating abnormally. Now I will be getting a replacement for the same . I would like to know if anyone else is also facing heating issue on the bottom right part of this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Only 8 GB RAM,Light weight, 3+ Hrs Battery Backup,only Problem :: 100% Disk Performance reduces its speed sometimes (as shown in Task Manager),\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t purchase this notebook by going by it&#39;s 8th gen intel processor only. HP has made so many cons with it screen display color inaccurate, battery fast discharging (2hrs), heating on the right side if u keep it on your lap , morever the keys in the keyboard is same as the body color u can&#39;t find it easy in typing unless u switch on the backlit . I had purchased it from online HP store , because of this issues got a DOA, &amp; waiting for a replacement.

 &#39;Worst product in my life...Worst service in Bangalore under warranty...After 2 months my laptop keyboard is not working. Till now I am waiting for hp service to repair even after 1 and half month already I reported to them\n&#39;,
 &#39;Hi,I am requesting you kindly send us fresh invoice copy with product serial number and model number,as we are facing some hardware issue for this product and HP asking us for an invoice letter with proper serial number and model number.Kindly share invoice copy for further procedure ......\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its performance is too slow.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is good!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Even Don&#39;t consider it for purchase.Screen size is too small so that it is an 10 Inch tablet.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;as soon as i saw this thing..i felt in love with it ...so i decided to buy it..atleast in this decade....i mortgage my house and got a loan for it....now m happy that i have this ...beside that m now jobless, homeless and ofcourse hopeless...do buy it...i highly recommend it....BRAVO\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a very good laptop.But caused me health issuesBecause living with 1 kidney is difficultBut buy it.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Just an amazing laptop, look at the dual screen, as if I can&#39;t buy a cheap monitor and connect it and put it beside my desk, no you are too cheap if you do that. The fact that amazon recommended me this laptop because I was looking for a cheap laptop is funny\n&#34;,
 &#39;Perfect but overpriced and ram should have  been 32gb.\n&#39;,
 &#39;its a very good machine,after buying this machine i m so happy,i lost my 1 eyes 1 kidneyand my house,\n&#39;,
 &#39;power full dual screen machine and fluent gaming\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good laptop worth every penny\n&#39;,
 &#39;So far, so good\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is good but available offline in HP World for Rs.89,000.It is super compact with good build quality, great design, good display, amazing speaker and good performance.The only con is little bit slow trackpad with bad palm rejection.Other things are good in this machine. The price on Amazon is higher than that of HP World.\n&#39;,
 &#39;1. Warranty status shows as already 5 months out. Only 7 months left in warranty. I have raised a dispute, yet to know the decision2. Takes ages to boot up and windows 10 is simply dead slow. Click on an icon, go have a tea and come back. You have still time to take a pee too.3. Display is too bright even at 30% brightness. Very low color saturation. You will hate seeing your photos on the screen4. No complaints on sound quality5. Has office 2016 preinstalled6. Intel HD graphics 620 and Nvidia Geforce\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product images are shown as black laptop but be actual product is silver color. It is misleading in formation to customers\n&#39;,
 &#34;It took about 1 hour to setup itself it failed at multiple points during setup of windows itself after starting it froze immediately i waited for 2 hours then hoping it will recover from crash but it didn&#39;t so i force restated after which it start repairing disk it went in for another 2 hours then i restarted again at this point it only showed blank screen. I guess tge problem with my unit is its hard drive got damaged in shipping.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Laptop is only looking good.Booting time is so longPerformance is  poorPrice is to high according to performanceWarranty is running outNot recomended don&#39;t buyDon&#39;t west of money\n&#34;,
 &#39;good sound and screen quality.. average battery backup\n&#39;,

 &#39;1) No warranty card inside the box2) Intel i3 7th Gen is delivered instead of i3 8th Gen this is fraud.\n&#39;,

 &#39;Heating problem with very poor battery life, not good for Dailey use. I purchased it for my travel purpose, but battery works for Hardly three to four hours.Very slow to operate and not so responsiveGood for show only not good for work.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I received the product on Tuesday afternoon, after initial setup only without installing any other software its hanging and blackout screen. Its booting time is only around two minutes.Don&#39;t go for this model.\n&#34;,

 &#39;Battery life low,touch screen is good,overall performance is good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Light weight\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;ls dont buy...One of the worst worst product on amazon. I purchased it from its good reviews but the battery is not working well..lappy shows some error while working laptop and the charging of battery reduces frequently at a higher level..i.e.in 1min of time span,battery charge reduces by 2-3%, it is extremely terrible as i got laptop just recently delivered. And more important thing that, as it is a new delivered product but also it hangs frequently and switch off suddenly. So this is a very big issue I have seen,as the product is so costly but quality of product is extremely so bad...I must say, a very bad deal with amazon.. I will not buy anything from Amazon henceforth.....\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product was  poor. Headphone jack not working. On the day of receiving, it stopped working. It shows windows logo and shuts down. On calling technical support of seller they say jack is not covered by them Which is absolutely non-sense. this is not written anywhere in details of product\n&#39;,
 &#39;\xa0Amazon selling the defective item, firstly there was heating problem then became touchpad issue clicking is not working.When I talk to customer care they forcefully provide the replacement instead of Refund.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;As discussed on phone I am still waiting for technician to review the window loaded in laptopThanks\n&#39;,
 &#39;Dublicate charger given ....otherthing as of now ok\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok ok\n&#39;,

 &#34;Nice laptop.. initially it was slow but after all the window updates it&#39;s working fine.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its a great laptop and below are the actual specsAgain it does not have 12 gb it has only 8 gb ram2 slots --- first 4 gb is onboarded ( cant remove)  Second slot has 4 gb ..* full hd* lift hinge design* 8 gb ddr4 ram* 1 tb 5400 hdd* 2 gb nvdia gpu* 14 inch display* i5 8th gen 8250u processor\n&#39;,
 &#34;purchased this device from an HP store for 63K. The device is made of using a combination of metal and plastic. The left side of the device always remains cool whereas the right side sometimes heats up as that&#39;s where the processor is located. The device was initially running a little slow and i was disappointed but once all the windows updates and drivers were installed everything changed and it&#39;s blazing fast now.The battery life is good and I get around 4 maybe 5 hours ( if you&#39;re listening to music+watching videos and surfing the web). You can easily get 9-10 hours out of it if you&#39;re using it to type up documents or make presentations with light browsing.Changing my review from 5 starts to 4 stars because watching movies on this device is incredibly hard. The screen is very reflective and I&#39;m looking at my own reflection half the time.RAM is 8GB not 12GB.Update after 2 months of usage-Battery life is still great, no lagging or slow down that is noticeable. only difference since the day i got it is that it takes maybe a couple of seconds longer to boot-up. even of low power mode + power savings enabled the devices breezes through most tasks effectively. I would also recommend users to actually make use of the windows 10 built in apps as compared to their alternatives as they appear to work better ( Microsoft edge, photos, groove music etc)&lt;&lt;random piece of advise. just in case you have a lot of  duplicate files use this free app called CloneSpy to get rid of any duplicates. helped me get rid of around 5gb in duplicate music files.&gt;&gt;\n&#34;,
 &#34;Look of this laptop is good or great it&#39;s a personal choice for me it&#39;s great.Display is FHD and for me it&#39;s good ( no bleeding issue )For how it works - u can guess that by it&#39;s configuration. ( I use this for simple browsing )Webcam is in b/w average to good.Typing experience is okaybattery - I got around little more then 3 hours in normal browsing with 50% brightness.Audio quality is good.But the problem which I found while using this laptop is it&#39;s touchpad.  Whole touch pad and right and left click are not separate so whole touch pad shake when u click . Else touch pad is not that responsive.Suggestion - u should check it&#39;s ports before buying this laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;\xa0I finally decided to buy this during the republic day sale and got it delivered yesterday (22 Jan2018) as i am a prime member. The spec is really good for this price and the asthetics of the laptop is very pleasing however i was shocked to realize that there is a manufacturing defect in the trackpad.The trackpad is not fixed properly to the frame, when i tap it slightly on the bottom centre or edges i can clearly see it moving up down and if i raise the laptop to my eye level i can see the trackpad is bulged out from the frame on the centre. I have raised this issue with amazon&#39;s technical team, i have sent them a short video of the problem and they have acknowledged that its a defect. Also i am very surprised as i don&#39;t understand how did this particular piece passed HP&#39;s quality checks.Finally got refund from amazon as the seller doesn&#39;t have any more stock left. A special appreciation for amazon.in technical team for promptly addressing this issue, I am changing my review to 4 star for support from amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Awesome laptop happy to buy..!!\n&#39;,
 &#39;I had purchased one from the HP store and it was having tremendous heating issue. The engineer from HP came to check and discovered that the HDD is heating abnormally. Now I will be getting a replacement for the same . I would like to know if anyone else is also facing heating issue on the bottom right part of this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Only 8 GB RAM,Light weight, 3+ Hrs Battery Backup,only Problem :: 100% Disk Performance reduces its speed sometimes (as shown in Task Manager),\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t purchase this notebook by going by it&#39;s 8th gen intel processor only. HP has made so many cons with it screen display color inaccurate, battery fast discharging (2hrs), heating on the right side if u keep it on your lap , morever the keys in the keyboard is same as the body color u can&#39;t find it easy in typing unless u switch on the backlit . I had purchased it from online HP store , because of this issues got a DOA, &amp; waiting for a replacement. Better go for asus vivobook or Dell 7373 Inspiron notebook which have a great display ..\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great Product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;we are not even using this laptop once in a week but its suffering us a lot. kindly look at the image while switching on its not getting start directly.. within few minuets laptop became very hot. we need to exchange the product. still we didnt get the proper response from the seller.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\&#39;t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&amp;O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed &amp; higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (&#34;HP assistant&#34; is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\&#39;t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop &amp; my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I was looking for a laptop that is:1. Two in one Laptop plus tablet that is 360 degree foldable but not detachable  and comes with a free pen2. Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don&#39;t do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it&#39;s okay, you don&#39;t get everything at this price point.  It&#39;s about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a &#39;cool&#39; look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)\n&#34;,
 &#34;With premium fit and finish to go with all the features mentioned, this model is a good combination of both form and functionality. The only grouse was that there was some lag initially while booting up, but that seems to have gone away on its own now. Also, it&#39;s only been a few weeks since I&#39;ve been using it, so I can&#39;t speak for its durability. This particular piece is a replacement piece - the original one that was delivered refused to start! So am a little worried - my experience with HP products has been great in the past, so let&#39;s hope this one also continues to reinforce that.Also, Get 10% cb and 6 months extended warranty by ordering through wplov .in/63\n&#34;,
 &#34;I bought this product in a hurry during Diwali time and I regret almost daily. Below are a few but most critical issues I have faced ever since I bought this laptop1) Extremely slow and loading takes hell lot of time2) Though manual update is enabled system goes for auto windows update in every 2 days time. Updates runs for 6/7 hours which means you never get time to use the laptop3) No matter how many times you run shut down command the laptop continues to be on unless you physically shut it down4) can&#39;t even open 4 Window tabs simultaneously as it crashes5) Overall nice looking fancy gadget without any practical utilities..Extremely disappointing and hope I can get it replaced.\n&#34;,
 &#39;\xa0This laptop has an SSHD for boot up , so ideally it should be fast and smooth but sadly that is not at all the case , the apps crash and the laptop lags and becomes irresponsive as soon as you shift to tablet mode also it has a problem of over heating. All in all the performance is highly dissatisfactory. I have a Macbookpro that i bought in 2014 and even that works better than the new HP x360 that i got. Also , even after constant attempts Amazon has not yet helped me getting a refund or even a replacement for the product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought it less than 10 days ago. Got a faulty product. Very slow and hanging always. Overheating too in 5 min. Very disappointed with HP and Amazon. Need replacement!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Have been using this laptop for the last 3 months and the issues seem to never end. It looks good, feels good and there ends the matter. I am already facing issues with the audio, the company claims it to be a software update issue. The heat sink stopped working and it&#39;s been more than 15 days since the complaint has been raised yet they have to replace the part not sure of they are yet to manufacturer it. Pathetic after sales service. The laptop is slower than a P1 system. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Will update this review once the part is replaced to see if it improves the performance.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is an awesome laptop. It has premium look. And as some review mentioned it is a bit slow with 4 GB ram but once you upgrade it to 8GB it runs smoothly without any single lag. After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe&#39;s light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn&#39;t actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it&#39;s deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have purchased HP Pavilion x360 14 inch, What a fantastic machine it is!  Screen touch, booting speed is really extra ordinary\n&#39;,
 &#34;Battery life won&#39;t even standby for 3 hours, the machine is super slow you can&#39;t open up more than four tabs in the browser. Any applications startup seems very slow very disappointed, deceived by the looks 😣\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;This lap top is good if we are using 4gb redeon graphics or Nvidia graphics. Don&#39;t go AMD Radeon 2gb graphics really it&#39;s waste otherwise u can go with integrated graphics Intel uhd 520 .one more thing what ever they mentioned about 2gb graphics it&#39;s wrong they mentioned 530 tesdeon but it&#39;s 320 readon it&#39;s really cheating customer\n&#34;,
 &#39;Sound and build quality needs to be improved. Working wonderfully with SSD installed at place of HDD. HDD replaced on SATA DVD drive with caddy. RAM upgrade upto 16 X 2 GB possible. Go for extended warranty.\n&#39;,
 &#34;The best laptop with HP Quality &amp; CS which can be provided at this range.From mid-gaming to programming - specially when running Android Studio , it doesn&#39;t lag.Sound is also great, it provides 30% minimum sound at it&#39;s max compared to a 30Watt 2.1When you&#39;ve turned up the power saver mode (in case using Windows) , it provides standby hoto 8 hours. In case ,its fully charged, I can full-charge my Nokia 5.1 by USB in standby 3+ times.If you want to unleash full power of this beast, you need to attach one 128/256GB SSD and one 8GB ram more &amp; you&#39;re good to go!\n&#34;,
 &#39;+ Best laptop at this range+ Better performance+ Value for money+ Built-in intel grphics is perfect+ Better battery performance+Processing speed is better(for developers)+ Sound quality is perfect,but- Low volume- amd Radeon 2 gb is not necessary,as  compare with Built-in Intel graphics- performance becomes weak when battery  beloww 10%USB port will be easily damageable,my 2  3.0 ports partially damagedAfter all,buy it now....😍😍😍\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy products from HP because they have a worst after sale service. Laptop is made up of low quality material. They will never repair your products under warranty. 8 months use experience. The laptop gets heated up low battery backup (2 -3 hrs power Backup). The screen resolutions is not up-to mark.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good laptop with great configuration. Fast delivery by Amazon, laptop built quality is not that much great (I used dell before this so comparatively low) camera is decent for video calls, overall go for it.....\n&#39;,
 &#39;Yeah. It’s good to use. So far no complaints. But one thing is it would be good if it comes with windows installation\n&#39;,
 &#39;Sound System good.but battery life is low...worth buying due to less or price and great specification.Brightness problem is seen\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good configuration.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent Product.  Core i5 with the latest 8th gen family.. Look and performance are good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Genuine product,i couldnt find any laptop at this price with windows10 pre installed.This one could be used for browsing and to work on MS office.Heavy gaming may not work with this configuration.Thank you.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product came with a virus! Am having the time of my life trying to use this horrid machine. Do NOT buy.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is good. But there not give any product key so you can&#39;t open Microsoft.\n&#34;,
 &#39;We need to install Microsoft and vlc media for this laptop when it is a basic thing to be there in every laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just four months of use and it’s lagging badly.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good As expected\n&#39;,
 &#39;very good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good\n&#39;,
 &#34;Can&#39;t even use to play cd or games\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its good\n&#39;,
 &#34;The seller (Rentopcdotcom) offers very poor quality refurbished items. I purchased a laptop (HP Elitebook 840G1). The laptop had spurious parts and when asked about it, they don&#39;t respond. The RAM was unbranded and incorrect frequency (used 1033 Mhz instead of 1600 for this model). The charger was spurious and also had issues providing correct voltage. The screen had dead pixels but was still called certified refurbished. The only saving grace was the appearance which was not too bad. Hence please don&#39;t order high RAM and hard disk/ SSD config from these guys as they are spurious anyway. Please expect to spend more money on hard disk/ ssd, RAM, charger, battery. as all of these will be spurious . If sold for 20k levels, this becomes a bargain as we can easily change RAM and HDD by just taking off the user removable cover.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop is perfectly working but second battery is missing,  pls arrane to send on priority.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Was really bad.... And worst too. Because within 3 months so many problems occurred. Now I am still stuck.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is very unusable because I returned it so they said it does not replace or returned\n&#39;,
 &#34;The renewed laptop that was delivered was in a poor condition with scratches all over. There was even a small crack on the top of the lid. I was okay with all that after all it was a renewed one. But once I started using it realised the battery of the laptop wasn&#39;t in a good condition too. Can only be used when plugged in and turns off instantly when disconnected from the plug.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have received a worth product. The seller of the product is selling the finest and quality worth product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Produxt is good but have lot of scratches and is actually more expensive than available in the market\n&#39;,

<pre>[&#39;According to HP it is a laptop but it falls under family of Notebook. From dimensions it should be classified as Notebook. Light weight, no DVD player and non replaceable Li-on battery. Good 2.3 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM works well. Windows 10 home opening and closing time normal. HP updates all drivers comfortably and window update works well. Box has only notebook and power chord. We have to get all other including warranty through HP website.I have loaded office pro and everything looks smooth. Display is good in some angles. Sound is ok. Very good key board and track pad. Worth buying for the price we pay.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product received as well be seen at description ...but it sometimes hang at when we start it , hang with chrome browser, hang in playing game, speed is slow but speed of the processor is seing 2.3 GHz but I am dissapointed because its the speed is so slow but why ???\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product was good,excellent laptop in look wise.Unhappy with Amazon facility delivery service. and one more important I got the laptop as per discription mentioned by the seller.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I do not recommend this if you are looking for a mid price range with at least acceptable speed! The speed is irritating!\n&#39;,
 &#39;All is good  yar\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its good in this budget18720\n&#39;,
 &#39;This product can be used for browsing purpose only, if you open 6-7 tabs at the same time this become worst to operate. Battery is not removable and no dvd port and if something happen then whole motherboard needs to replace.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good but not received cashback in HDFC debit cards cashback offer\n&#39;,
 &#39;Feeling very satisfied after using this laptop.Speed is very good, body material also solid.Recommend to purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Lapi is good . It&#39;s fulfill my requirements but where is warranty card bro?\n&#34;,
 &#39;Works very slow.. Apart from this there are no issues in this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;The time clock battery is not working right out of the boxTerrible support... dont buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s good, but I don&#39;t get warranty card,\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its really A light weight Notebook by HP.Overall performance is good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not satisfied with products ..there is no invoice bill or waranty card\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome product..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok\n&#39;,
 &#39;MS Office work Slow browsing speed good some time hang up with Google ChromeMemory run out problem 😂\n&#39;,
 &#39;Speed is very slow?but whyVery bad leptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;WROST,  with in 7days creatng problem.\n&#39;,
 &#39;best product  best price\n&#39;,
 &#39;There was no Mouse along with the Laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#34;\xa0Don&#39;t Bought to anyone, Because he&#39;s not replacements and refunds for this product.Battery Backup is very very poor and Laptop Hanging issues.Totally Money Waste, Kindly Go to Direct HP laptop showroom.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Quality some low\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very usable and compelling although a little slow that&#39;s why I replaced laptops mechanical hard drive with SSD and erased Windows and installed Linux mint 19.2, you&#39;ll definitely gonna see speed up performance boost.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Started giving problems within 7 days.had to replace HDD.I didn&#39;t had to pay since it was under warranty.and I was told that the components were of a very cheap quality.sort of a use and throw laptoo\n&#34;,
 &#39;The laptop is very nice but the problem is when we are charging earthing is coming\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s good in bought\n&#34;,
 &#39;I thought HP is very good company with Low range laptop. But it was wrong. I have 4 Low range laptop of Asus and this time I thought lets buy HP in low range. Overall quality is good but performance is very slow compare to Asus Low range series laptop which is under 20,000.I Suggest you to go only with Asus if you have budget under 20,000.I have some high range laptop in my organization with HP brand. In high range performance is good with HP.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice performance\n&#39;,
 &#34;my review is for hp 434tx i3 7th gen. after i bought this i should suggest you that never buy any hp laptop. they hang like hell. and their customer care support is the worst. they talk about extension of warranty with 6000 rupee with free headphone, but their support team never visits your home, why should you extend warranty if they didn&#39;t come? you will get a call saying we may come? rain ? stupid\n&#34;,
 &#34;The bluetooth devices can&#39;t receive nothing\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;There is no sound in the laptop even after installing necessary drives.Please suggest solution otherwise I will return the item.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazon showing wrong pictures, the keyboard will also have silver colorIf anyone read this review to buy this laptop, it might be useful\n&#39;,
 &#39;I would request customers who have brought items on EMI through SBI card pleasr check your statement details as I had brought this prouduct on EMI of 9666/- including interest but bank is charging additional interest on this. 9666 + 330. Actually if they had to charge then they should have charged either 9666 per month or 9444+interest for three month. I would request Amazon also to look into the matter so that customers can freely use SBI cards for EMI payment.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m reviewing this laptop after 4 month of use.Pros:- Overall looks seems interesting.- Screen size and display is awesome.- 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, 1 RJ45 connector,  USB 3.5 JACK, SD card slot, CD Rom.- With Intel i3 7th gen this laptop works  fine with all applications and  browsing experience is too good.Cons:- You need to wait a minute after starting this laptop to be able to work. Else, it starts to hang.- Full size keyboard. The numeric buttons on the right should not be present.Overall verdict:Decent laptop at this price.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Let me start with my message stating Very unsatisfactory product. It is i3 7th gen with 4gb Ram but it is slower than a celeron processor my other laptop. Infact cant be compared as simple basic task like sending mail cant work in this laptop forget the gaming etc. VERY VERY SLOW . 100% memory and 100 % DISK usage show all the time in if u open task manager.I mailed HP looking at the messages from HP from other reviews. It seemed to be quite promising that someone from HP customer care will take the laptop solve it or replace it sad thing no one even bothered to reply to my mail.So sick HP service.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have purchase this laptop  and use from last 20 days. Performance wise it is very slow .bulky and not comfortable for everyday use.Suggestions : You will get better laptop in the same price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this laptop a day ago.It is mentioned in amazon that this laptop has lifetime validity for ms office.But actually it is not.We need renew it every year.Feeling very very disappointed with Amazon for mentioning a wrong feature.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bloody product doesn&#39;t power on at all... When called customer support they reply so adamantly...\n&#34;,
 &#39;display quality and speed both are very bad.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Kindly update about products it&#39;s original by HP?Find the photos and confirm the same.I am using currently i5 and i3 but this one looking different\n&#34;,
 &#34;First of all the performance was nothing to write home about.I spent more time downloading and installing updates than actually using the laptop.It was dead slow too. It altogether stoppedworking after 7 months. I contacted HP customer care and they advised software recovery.I tried the steps advised by them still it is not booting.The product is still under warranty and it was used only for online classes and basic browsing IE, no gaming or other heavy stuff.I requested a service visit but they declined saying that for software issues service visit can not be arranged.I don&#39;t know what is the use of Guarantee and buying a licensed Windows version .As I am living at a remote place with no nearby service centre,I am left with no option other than dumping the item with this kind of support from HP.Should serve as as eye opener for any one planning to go for an HP laptop.After almost one month the laptop is still not repaired.Should serve as an indicator of the much pom-pom Ed HP service.My advise is please desist from buying this crapUpdate:Now HP says the defect is on hard disk. The service engineer replaced the hard disk. However the USB media I bought from HP shelling out Rs. 1100 is not working. Finally the service engineer installed windows by cloud recovery. (however HP has promised a free replacement of the recovery media). Subsequently the keypad started functioning erratically. The lappy is still at the service centre. I don&#39;t know  what to make of the whole process\n&#34;,
 &#39;On first Boot it took around 2.30 hrs  after that never booted always hanged during booting totally waste of money and tension of not returning  this trashPro: Advice goto showroom first try lappy dn buy because for online marketing. They are just selling crap\n&#39;,
 &#39;Please go with another brand,for mine system is crashed within 6 hours of delivery of laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros1) sound quality is good2) picture quality is satisfactory3) camera is average, OK in this price range4) keypad is comfortable5) life time validity for windows 10 home and MSO student.Cons1) anti virus macafee is trial version for 30 days2) opening of applications are slow, better to go for i5.3) battery is not easily removable.NoteValue for money laptop. But compromised in performance.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good product.Awesome battery backupWorth for moneySimple drawback is that it doesn&#39;t have antiglare display\n&#34;,
 &#39;Hello Folks,The product review shared by other always help me, buy a product so It is my responsibility to write the review.This laptop I bought 2 weeks ago. Till now my observations are:Pros:Light in weight.Single coat so appearance is nice.Keyboard is robustSound quality is good.Cons:If you want speed this is not a product to buy.Charging speed is not great.Touch pad is not that smooth.Laptop soon become very hot.Overall if you do not want to play games &amp; budget is less than 30 k. You can give this product a thought.Thanks for reading Hope it will be helpful.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worse purchase I ever had in Amazon. I won&#39;t complain anything about Amazon, but here hp is providing low quality product. The laptop&#39;s display got damaged within 1 month without any physical damage. When I asked for the warranty they rejected it saying it&#39;s not manufacturing defect.it&#39;s actually a manufacturing defect due to to low quality parts and hp is blaming customer for such occurance.Don&#39;t ever trust in hp products..\n&#34;,
 &#39;would recommend dell laptop over HP after buying this (i have used dell and they are far better than HP)only two major advantages of this laptopms officegreat speakerthe display is low quality, system is slowi have dell also with an older configuration and it performs a lot better\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice sound quality ,nice backup of 4.5 hrs ,value for money\n&#39;,
 &#34;This laptop is dead slow. I am using an MSI laptop 2013 model which is far better than this. Actual laptop cannot be this much slow, I am sure this is not original. Please don&#39;t buy through online. I am into ecommerce side but  I would say never but through online. I replaced the one I received first but replaced one also not bad. I feel I will break this, I have to wait to open a new tab also.. Sad.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;When system is turned on it takes much time say 20 mins to turn on, provided that I have installed minimal softwares. And restart of system requires more than 1 hr stating that all the updates are running in the background.Sql server will be the only heavy weight software installed, and more than 250gb of hard disk is free. Win 10 preinstalled, i3 7th gen processor. Does anyone face the same issue.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Awesome looking laptop....i don&#39;t know why this much negative reviews.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I am really very very disappointed with the performance of this laptop. From the first day till now it never worked normally......lots of hanging issue. For every task it will take minimum of double time and after that also it will be working slowly. Even if I am typing something it will appear after few seconds. I m really tired up of using this laptop and regret of buying this. Look wise it&#39;s awesome battery life also average but one and only major problem with this laptop is it get stucked after any command given it includes from starting the laptop to opening your files to typing anything......I don&#39;t know why I bought this laptop ...... seriously not expected from Amazon to deliver the product like this....I sometimes feels that it&#39;s even original or not ??\n&#34;,
 &#39;Worst product from HP. Performance is too slow. Applications hangs frequently. I got defective one in which speaker head phone was not working. Warranty was also not showing as one year.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money is good but sounds quality is normal and battery life is only three hours. In a nutshell this laptop is good in its price range. Thank you.\n&#39;,
 &#39;First of all the product packing was just great..Second , the laptop is gud.Pros-Anti glare display is just great.Keyboard is gud .Camera is avg.Multitasking is just great.Sound is loud and clear.Laptop is lightweight.Cons-Lags a bit sometimes.Maybe an upgrade of SSD drive will improve performance.For gamers RAM nd Graphics needs to be upgraded.Good for medium gaming.Overall a great laptop in this budget of 31k.\n&#39;,
 &#34;In a single word- it&#39;s worth. Initially you may feel that is slow but after updates it will work smoothly.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I received this product on 9th May 2019, as I&#39;ve not installed any app but it is too slow. Whatever I open it takes too much time to open. Better to go with Dell or Lenovo. Not satified with this kind of product from HP.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have brought this product almost 1 month back and also submit the complaint on his slow performance. Also I have taken remote support from hp help desk service center but no improvement. Hence they sending there home assistance who is still not turn over and making arrangements as per my availability.Currently seeking hp revert. Or needs to return back such faulty product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow laptop. Bad purchase now stuck with it. How do I sell this piece of junk?\n&#39;,
 &#39;Super quick delivery as always from Amazon.Have been using this laptop everyday for about 8hrs with not a single issue faced till date.Not sure about its performance for gaming as I have never used it for gaming.Battery life is also pretty good. 4-5hrs with the power saver mode on and mildly heavy usage.Easy to carry around as does not weigh too much and its very compact as well.Overall performance is good with reasonably heavy usage but I have not tested with heavy usage, programming and gaming.My opinion: PRETTY REASONABLE, GOOD PERFORMANCE, LIGHT WEIGHT, VALUE FOR MONEY.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good laptop with a very beautiful colour and design.. WINDOWS 10 needs upgrade .. after completing of all updation it runs fast..I am very satisfied with this laptop..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall laptop is goodA colour that is not common.(standard)Display is superb depend upon the quality you see.Mcafee antivirus for 30 day trial.Performance - goodDisplay- excellentStorage- plenty and enoughGood for programming.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not as per expectations built quality is very poor not perform as per specification. I think always buy from hp outlet\n&#39;,
 &#39;Review after using 15days...Too slowwwww, worst product by HP, no response by customer care of Amazon.Go with dell or lenovo or any other brand but not with HP or Amazon service.Laptop on krk so jao 😴😴😴😴Can get better laptop in same price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product and meets my requirement\n&#39;,
 &#39;In first place Laptop got delayed while delivering it to me. We called amazon told upfront that we don’t need and when we are trying to return the same without opening the packaging amazon not taking the amazon back. It is just selling the High price products to customers just with images and text and these is no way to return it back if you don’t need or don’t like it or performance is not at your expectations.Poor amazon policy , if you buy this you need to buy with your own risk and it will be final sale and there is no way to return and live with it.When we are trying to down load or upload or trying to install our first software it is Super slow.When we are trying to view YouTube videos and Dragged the video here and there to see the performance and laptop is kind of stuck and responding after 1 or 2 mins. Even when you make video in full screen mode it will take a while to pop up.What not there several performance issues with this laptop Never ever buy this and Don’t Don’t Don’t Don’t Buy this.When we are extracting 500Mb file from zip , Memory reads and memory utilization going up to 100% and you can’t use any application and Dam super SlowUpdated comments on 27-jul-2019 : we have requested for technician visit and tech guy confirmed that there is a issue finally amazon provided replacement and replacement is more worst you can see The pics which I have updated in the review.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Avoid buying this laptop. It looks like someone has put a duplicate processor and RAM inside it. It is painfully slow. I am considering to throw it away and buy a better laptop from Market.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Product activation key missingVery very very very slowI&#39;m totally pissed up...Plz never ever buy this product for God sake\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very bad. System is  very  slow. Getting hanged\n&#39;,
 &#39;After using it for 2 weeks i am writing my review.It is very nice and very useful product. It is for daily use. Battery life is good. It get charged very fast. Screen quality is awsome. I think that camera quality should little bit improve otherwise everything is okey\n&#39;,
 &#39;I love this product. Packing quality is also so good.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bootup process is very very slow.MS office &amp; Antivirus trial period was over when I bought.There is no drive partition (Only &#39;C&#39; drive). Battery backup time is 2 - 2.5 hours only.Wifi sucks my jio 4g data very fastly.HP should mention USB 2 port &amp; USB 3 port type.  &#39;C&#39; type USB port is missing.Keyboard letters are very thin &amp; difficult to read and type in low light(HP should provide keyboard back light).HP should relocate the heat vents instead of under display area.When using long time, bottom area of the display screen is overheating.It may affect screen and laptop is too heavy to lift.Otherwise nice laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Just..... Kaam chalauHaving heating issue while charging.So much hanging problem... In just normal daily use\n&#39;,
 &#39;1-Before arrived My Order HP Laptop  i got a message someone will come for Installation but nobody came2- I have read before buy clearly mentioned will be replacement within 10 day\&#39;s if i don\&#39;t with performance3-  I really don\&#39;t like voice quality and picture quality and I called up for replacement another productbut i got to know through cus care it can be replace same one if any default but can\&#39;t replace with other product which no where mentionedReally Really disappointed as regular customer since many year&#34;s\n&#39;,
 &#34;Gadget Guys.. Here&#39;s a short review of the above model Lappy that I bought today.Design - Very GoodWeight - Surprisingly very light from HPSpecs - Nice config in such a decent budgetFHD Screen - a New addition and quite good resolution especially with Anti-GlareBattery - the most interesting aspect of this Lappy, charged it twice as used heavily to test it. Gives a pretty good backup of 4hrs. Very much satisfiedi3 and 4GB DDR4 combo is performing more than I expected. Initial booting and updates are gonna make feel that the Lappy is slow, but give it time to setup, later Lappy just flies.Overall a pretty good Lappy at an affordable price 😊👍And all this coming in a package of 26.5k in offer after applying Credit Card offers\n&#34;,
 &#39;I just bought, this product from Amazon not too much satisfied from product in range of 31k. Speaker quality is very poor, screen quality is not up to the mark, Not good from my side.But thankful to Bajaj finserv to fulfill our financial need.. 😀 Thnx Bajaj and Amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;You get what you pay for. The modest pricing is reflective of the responsiveness of the system. However, it does the job as an entry level laptop for basic browsing, reading or as a secondary laptop for use by children.Biggest pros are the screen size and the extended keyboard with a dedicated number pad.Biggest cons would be the slowness of the laptop and the absence of a backlit keyboard (though the latter was known before purchase).\n&#39;,
 &#39;This one is non performing  laptop .Every application is hanging. It does not properly shut down.Microsoft office is quite slow. Sometimes it does not start properly &amp; starts after 10 mins. I have asked Amazon to return it.I wish I should have not purchased this from Amazon.This is my worst experience with Amazon.  They are now not taking back the laptop &amp; they do not return &amp; refund my money.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is very slow laptop and slower than my 6 year i3 laptop which i had purchased it almost same price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;very worst product . pathetic laptop . hangs every day 8 to 10 times . waste of money . seller not willing to take back within return period . amazon these kind of sellers will surely take down your reputation in market\n&#39;,
 &#34;Please dont buy this junk product. Even I dont want to rate single star, but no other choice, i gave 1 star.Starting from booting to everything was bad... booting nearly 30-40 mins, if you click any app, it will take its own time to come back, sometimes, not coming back at all. I can&#39;t believe its i3 and 4 GB ram. very very very worst product ever I seen.even 19th century computer was good compared to this junk product. I&#39;m not sure, how HP delivered this product? they didnt do any quality check? instead of correct spareparts, hp delived this model with scrap items?  I was an HP employee and never had this kind of worst experience with HP product. If HP deliver this kind of product, then HP share value will be zero soon. please wake up...  call back this product immediately.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I am totally disappointed with this product. I thought HP will done the job but it&#39;s do slow. Not only that, it often hanging. Is it HP or any local product? How a branded product can be so?\n&#34;,
 &#34;Very bad product no one can purchase waste of money very slow performance like 1 gb mobile phone so hang Battery back up 1 hour if u want to waste your money so purchase otherwise don&#39;t purchase any item from this seller customer care said there is no return policy product not returned\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a decent product in this price range, it could have been lighter though.  With windows 10 preloaded it&#39;s definitely value for money. One of the buttons was getting stuck, but amazon after sending a technician and verifying has immediately replaced it with a new laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t buy this, extremely slow.. My 8 years old laptop works better than this..\n&#34;,
 &#34;Purchased this product today along with MS Office .  But while activating ms office it seeks product key. Pls help me.  Where can I get the MS Office key. In package no document regarding ms office.After using 6 months now the mouse is lagging in Windows 10, tried with all obtion but unable to rectify it. Therefor,now using Bluetooth mouse and it&#39;s ok. Other than this issue system is superb and working greatly.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t hesitate to buy this product if you are a student because it is the best entry level laptop which serve every important functions for every student so please don&#39;t hesitate buy itIt also has a pre installed MS officeWindows 10Value for money\n&#34;,
 &#39;As per specifications of laptop, I have to receive lifetime warranty of ms office, but I have got warranty of 1 week and even I have raised a query which is still not replied.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good laptop for my home use. MS Office was pre-loaded and set up was smooth. A bit slower at starting than my expectation for Core i3 7th Gen, but otherwise good value at this pricepoint.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very bad experience worst laptop hanging problem from the first day even on personal use I m not using this laptop for playing games and all still this hang on doing very simple task . I thing this is not even have i3 processor becz I3 perform very well . Seller are doing fraud on the laptop i3 sticker but inside tha laptop is just garbage fill.Worst performance worst laptop don&#39;t buy this go for Dell laptop these are good then Hp.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Ekdam ghatiya h..act like old laptop.. performance is too slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop is very slow!! It takes lot of time to start! Battery backup is also bad.. No warranty card provided along with laptop.. poor display.. Msoffice is valid only for 1 month\n&#39;,
 &#39;System come with windows 10 and office suite, but the booting speed is very slow , if you are planning to upgrade system to SSD we can get a better performance wich is 5 * Faster.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Only screen border is black rest of all parts in silver...u cant work in dark area coz there is no light in keybords keys\n&#39;,
 &#39;In this range I guess this is a good laptop. There was a single drive no partition so that one can change. Installing everything in C drive slows down your lappy.Secondly, I had an issue with a black screen error every time I log in into that. But after that it was successfully replaced. Thanks team.You can buy this at this budget\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought laptop : HP 15-da0327tu 2018 15.6-inch almost 6 months back.  I am totally struck-up with this laptop:1) takes almost 10 minutes to boot up fully.2) Always showing that disk usage is 100% , thought i have only 10% of data in c-drive.3) Google chrome &amp; edge browsers always hangs.Now I am planning to contact HP customer to resolve this , i hope.CORE i3 is not good with windows 10. Always better to go for i5 and above if OS is windows 10.\n&#39;,
 &#39;best quality\n&#39;,
 &#39;For windows 10 to operate smoothly you must have at least 8Gb RAM.The laptop is extremely SLOW and LAGGY.Buying this I ended up in regret.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Extremely slow machine. I only use it for ms word and the laptop is extremely slow.On boot the disk utilization is always 86 to 100%. Processor utilization stays above 47% regardless of me leaving it idle.It is not upto the mark and the performance is not consistent with the specifications advertised.\n&#39;,
 &#39;There is no provision for 0.000000001 star. If it was available I would have given it. The laptop runs very slow. Just like 2G network takes time to open link.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop is good. Reasonable price for the config. Battery seems to drain little faster as compared to the description given. There was some lagging issues after startup but after few changes in setting its running fine. The Keyboard is very soft and easy to use and the num. pad makes it more handy while typing numbers. It could have been better if the keys were of different colour.Overall its good.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Bought this laptop.. since day one this laptop is not working properly have lodged a complaint before given period but after many attempts, I&#39;m unable to contact Amazon customer service.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Battery is good bt sound quality is quite average or u can say below average , processor is also averageTotally disappointed with the product ..\n&#39;,
 &#39;It was too bad experience for me from amazon, like I got used product.Literally packing of laptop was too bad, I can say there was no packing at all.And another surprise was when I unboxed laptop there was already profile created with name “jitu Pawar” that too password protected.You must be seen profile in my above click.Not expected from Amzon.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Best product at this price range.1. Weight is decent2. Gaming performance is not very high.3. I personally like this product because of Battery life. One times of full charge gives me 10 to 12 hours of backup.4. I am using this for last 12 or 13 days, but i have no hanging issues also.Overall if you don&#39;t buy the laptop only to play games then i can say this is the best product at this price.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Inspite of having 4GB RAM, it system gets changed. No point of this laptop. It takes minutes to start and to open basic application like Ms excel, ms word and browser like  Chrome, there is a time lag it doesn&#39;t function smoothly.. Sad I wasted my 30k for this trash...\n&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow\n&#39;,
 &#34;Sir/madamAs per the requirements...i don&#39;t have Ms office. I don&#39;t have the bag which was already attached by the factory. So I need a immediate call from you. Otherwise I will return the laptop. Screen quality is not good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;Dear Sir / Madam,I have purchased HP laptop, its touch-pad isn&#39;t working well. Need to return back the same. Please co-ordinate asap.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Worst Laptop in the world...Issues:1: Dead Slow2: Frequently hang3: Battery Backup not up to the mark.4: Trouble in downloading anything5: Need Admin access for everything..Overall, Waste of pure hard earned money into the product which is not worth half of it... Go for different..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery life not much good, problem is the silver white body colour, easily catch scratches and be dirty easily,,, one should go for black colour body laptop  ,,\n&#39;,
 &#34;The worst Product i have ever bought from Amazon and has hadn&#39;t seen such a worst laptop in my life .I had bought this product for my mother three months ago. From the beginning onwards this product had been getting hanged frequently and at this point of time i am unable to atleast switch On this product. More over, it has to be noted that even though the product had on site warranty the HP service team was reluctant to do onsite service. Please read and decide before purchasing this product.HP must re-engineer this and must replace me with another.\n&#34;,
 &#34;The laptop has primitive configuration and will be outdated soon. I wonder why this laptop is still in market by HP.The good things - It starts quickly and the time taken for sleep and wake up is very less.The bad things - It is excruciatingly slow if you have 4 or more tabs opened of a browser - especially with google chrome. There is likely chance of Laptop freezing for more tabsThe worse - The network adapter doesn&#39;t support 5 GHZ band and the 4 GB RAM is just inadequate.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very cheap compared to showrooms outside.Received the brand new lappy with good packaging. Comes with pre-installed Ms Office. I3 7th generation processor. But still there are some lags while performaning normal tasks. Taking a lot of time for booting. Not recommend for gaming.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The worst ever product of hp till now..It broke My trust in hp as I.m using hp products since so many years.. So pls inform hp or their dealers to atleast sought it As this laptop is in warranty period..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is not good “even bad” as it’s getting hang on regular basis\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop has very  Poor finishing. Gaps are seen towards the right side as the keyboard panel is away from the cd disc. Scratches are also seen.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worst performance ever in this price range. Extremely slow and very less sound\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very bad experience of the product. After using 1-2 months, suddenly one spot had appeared in the screen and gradually it was increasing. Went to service center, they are telling screen damage not fall under warranty. My suggestion is don&#39;t buy laptop and other expensive products from Amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Speed of machine is slowest , not good for basic school work also , wonder why hp has bundled such bad product , that might be reason for low price .... will not advise anyone to buy even if price reduced by 50%\n&#39;,
 &#34;Useless productVery slow processingIt&#39;s better to buy product from a showroom, rather than from Amazon\n&#34;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Something quite disappointed in performance. A quilty of buying online because of its slow system. It is very slow than other systems. Seems some defective like.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Laptop works slow as compare to Dell which is purchased by my friend.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is great. I3 is all you need if your usage is only for everyday surfing, movies and MS officeNot meant for gamingCame with life time valid OS 10 and MS office\n&#39;,
 &#39;At first there was some confusionLaptop is not booting when power is switched onI opt for return but not thereContacted HP support no answerAt last amazon came to helpThey told to charge for3hrsThen it is okHp people pl listen other wise bad impressionsAt least give some hints\n&#39;,
 &#39;over hole laptop colour is good  but keypad silver colour not good very light and 4 gm ram not good hang problem so  i assemble a extra 4 gb ram then performance will be good so pls dont buy 4 gm ram laptop 8 gb ram laptop buy and bilvery of this product very very bad amazon divery agent not pick the call 30 time calling but no rply and amzon not return a amount not replace so choice your frnd\n&#39;,
 &#39;How to avail warranty as my laptop is not working...when I took laptop to HP service center then they are asking for laptop serial no on invoice but it is missing. Kindly help me out.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Processor is too slow and also often hang.....And also one keypad key is damaged.... don&#39;t buy this laptop...\n&#34;,
 &#39;Nice...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Absolutely patheticAmazon does not give any support in any case.,.nor even contact details for HPMy laptop become useless in less than 10 more thosePathetic\n&#39;,
 &#39;extremely slow, takes more than 5 minutes to boot up and 2 minutes to switch between windows\n&#39;,
 &#34;Processing speed is too slow, don&#39;t even opens basic apps smoothly like office or web browsers. No benefits of buying Genuine windows\n&#34;,
 &#39;This device has gone faulty within a month. Device has stopped booting\n&#39;,
 &#39;Defective  product  send my sellers\n&#39;,
 &#39;It keeps on hanging every time one of the worst laptop ever bought compared to Dell i3 2 nd gen 4 GB ram 320 GB harddisk. I fell my old laptop was far better than this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s worst laptop ...I never seen such useless device in my life ...He is too slower even  nursery boy&#39;ll be faster than this device\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is the worse products i ever bought.I totally dnt like its feature moreover it hangs all the time.i ask them to return bt they instead ask me to update it. I dnt want to keep the product.. and i want to return it as soon as possible\n&#39;,
 &#39;If your budget is around 30 to 32k, this is a very good bye. For general purpose, this is an excellent product. For many this is slightly slow. During first time booting it took a lot of time because of a great no of updates. But after finishing the updates its performance is great.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst laptop ever.Service of amazon is good but product is not good as like offline store.Don&#39;t buy this product from Amazon bcz the smallr not send HP&#39;s genuine laptop.Heating issue in the right side of touchpad and it is too slow rather than other i3 products.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its been over a month using this laptop. I am happy with its performance in every way. Perfectly as everything is described.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Pros: Very Good Look Wise.Display Nice As compared to Other Laptops In this Price Range.Cons: Its Hangs If you Browsing with Multi TAB&#39;s .Not Reliable for Gaming. Even It hangs with office software, like word, excel.Note: Go with 8GB RAM model it works well.\n&#34;,
 &#39;No one can like this because this laptop may be unexpected for you so be aware and stay away for this laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;Super but ms office not instal\n&#39;,
 &#34;Product is good but i haven&#39;t receive any warranty card and this is big fault from Amazon side and this is not acceptable. It&#39;s look like Amazon doing fraud with their customer&#39;s. I have tried so many times to customer services but the number isn&#39;t connecting....\n&#34;,
 &#39;This product is good but its delhivered without warenty card and without windows 10....So everyone  when you to buy plz check all information to this product and DEAR AMAZON plz check this issue and solved for your belivable customers.....  Thank you.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Such a good looking laptop, with full HD screen and good sound quality\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worthless. No properly support from Amazon.\n&#39;,
 &#39;NYC superb in this budjet ....dizz product ,,,,,it consuming more data\n&#39;,
 &#34;To be genuine I&#39;m happy with the product 4gb ram is ok but I&#39;ll add 8 gb to get more robust experience. Overall good laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#39;This lappi is very slow it takes too much time to open chrome or any other app u want to use. I bought 3 products from Amazon but none of them made me feel happy to buy those products. I have decided that I will not buy anything from Amazon in future\n&#39;,
 &#34;Ok Good Laptop For Every Day Tasks. Average Laptop At This Price 30490.There&#39;s no information available for which type of SSD Should be Installed.\n&#34;,
 &#34;As compared price it&#39;s not worth it . Battery is draining fast ☹️\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is too slow working on stuffing, ms office.Taking to many times while it is starting\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazing product. But you need to add extra 4gb ram to make the best use of it. Without an additional ram the laptop gets too slow while multitasking. Extra 4gb ran costed me about 2000 from nehru place of kingston.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this laptop but when I am opening  the MS office  it says  to buy  MS office why is this  so when we have purchased life time windows 10\n&#39;,
 &#34;All HP product are not good working.Also HP support and services  poor .. Please don&#39;t buying HP product Dell items better than HP items\n&#34;,
 &#39;Response time is slow and battery draining fast.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product had some quality issues. It was very fragile. Waste of money. The service is so poor. Never buy this product\n&#39;,
 &#34;Not working properly it takes 5 minutes to start n off don&#39;t buy dis\n&#34;,
 &#39;Worth every penny\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not recommended to buy the laptop as the laptop is extremely slow, and HP Support does not have a good solution to the problem\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery, sound , build quality is good, but i3 processor is slow unless you are very rarely use laptop and that to for simple usesage you can take it otherwise go for i5.\n&#39;,
 &#39;System very slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;All good;Battery backup (4-5), Fast Charging, Nice sleek looking, games &amp; application works very well.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst Product. Don&#39;t buy this.. can&#39;t work on multiple windows. Hangs a lot very very very slow after each and ever click you should wait wait wait to respond.  It&#39;s a fancy peice looks attractive but not worth it..\n&#34;,
 &#39;I bought it this for 28,500 value for the money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not good product.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very very slow.  I can&#39;t work on it.\n&#34;,
 &#34;New laptop is taking longer time to respond any app..Performance very bad,  don&#39;t buy this.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop durability and battery life is good. But its bit on slower side. It takes around 3:25 mins for login windows\n&#39;,
 &#39;After one and half months, battery is not charging why ? Today it is showing 79% of battery why ?. When unplug the AC adaptor it is directly swith off why ? Please let me know the answer to solve the problem.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The material of body making is very bad,like a glass breaking type not a solid material.Very very bad making material\n&#39;,
 &#34;Only looking good otw very unsatisfactory product. Speed is very slow .Don&#39;t go with this .\n&#34;,
 &#39;very slow laptop .....\n&#39;,
 &#34;We are using from last one month. Got small defect, right side panel is not fully attached with screen. Laptop is very slow. From day we were observing. There is no much use hence haven&#39;t checked regularly\n&#34;,
 &#34;Slowest laptop in the world dnt like it not value for money...don&#39;t buy it...\n&#34;,
 &#34;I have not used much.. but it&#39;s looking good... I have a complain that it cost me extra RS. 500/- I booked on 28th as prime customer.. On 29th it was RS. 500/- less.. it cost me more due to prime customer\n&#34;,
 &#39;Useless\n&#39;,
 &#39;The system is very slow and it gets hang easily. The Ram is low . People should not choose products like laptop from Amazon. They should physically verify the product from the stores.\n&#39;,
 &#39;No problem in operation\n&#39;,
 &#39;Veryyy very slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;its good, but hangs a bit, may be due to internet speed issues. MS Office is paid version and not free as claimed by amazon. Batter is inbuilt and cannot be dismounted. sound quality is not that good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Keypad are too bad\n&#39;,
 &#39;Dumbest decision I’ve ever made, slowest laptop I have seen, even clean format doesn’t work please don’t waste your money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worst lapi I have ever seen. Too slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow, takes lot of time to start and then hangs. i bought it for my kid as a middle range laptop but it is useless and user experience is frustrating. waste of money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros.  Light weight. Slim design..good battery life... Fast charging. .  ... Extra features..Cons. . Take hell lots of time start. And booting system kind of slow.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bougt this product in last month and found that one led of screen is not working. I misplaced the bill hence i could not replace the product\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is extremely slow. Am thinking about Ram upgrade.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow. It is not better for regular use. Performance less than 1gb ram\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great product quality as always HP provides.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I recently purchased this item and feel happy about its performance and build quality.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Graphics is not suitable for gaming.to slow to start.After one I have faced black screen problem.also suddenly shut down.warranty not shown in hp website.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall the laptop is very disappointing.. battery backup is good.. display quality is good.. but working slowly.... you have to install ssd and upgrade ram for smooth work\n&#39;,
 &#39;when I buy this product then I faced hanging issue and now its keypad does not working I raised the complain but no one resolve my issue..... very very very very very bad product and service of hp\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst product third grade quality which made by China ,don&#39;t buy in  online , not worth for money\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good for school and office\n&#39;,
 &#39;I am writing review after using it. Battery life is 3-4 hours, picture quality is average , processing speed is also average.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Product was to slow worst product from HP company Don&#39;t buy laptop from HP company and amazon\n&#34;,
 &#39;Run like P1 system...most of the time hang hang hand and update window everytime.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Waste for the money it&#39;s not working full hanging problem taking so much of time please see the vedio\n&#34;,
 &#39;Nice laptop very smooth keyboard, good for gaming, and windows 10 given, only touch screen not given in this laptop apart from this over all performance is excellent.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its not worth do not purchase this product  because it is very slow to work\n&#39;,
 &#39;Verry slow, screen quality bery wrist, this product look like 1year old. I am verry disappointed for hp quality,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Working very good .. ms office not included.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The performance of the laptop is very poor, it’s taking more time for opening apps and files, always getting hang. It is not at all useful to me.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worst product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Got this HP laptop for my friend and it really works well. Nice product from HP as usual and genuine service from AMAZON. Thank you amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;Anti glare - yesFor Gaming- goodPortability- 9 pints out of 10In this budget, best option to purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slowly starting..... It will be take 15 mins.....\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery backup is very good , speed  is little slow but nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst of money i suggest to all don&#39;t buy it because this laptop keyboard is not good for typing and also not visible words mentioned on keys due to silver colour keys and board.\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is the worst laptop in the market.very slow such that you can not even do basic things browsing and all.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Some bug in Windows 10. The laptop doesn&#39;t sleep or hibernate. Battery keeps discharging...\n&#34;,
 &#39;Slover speed as expected, Never buy costly electronic item like laptop and etc.\n&#39;,
 &#39;After purchased only I got to know that it came with out MS office . Very worst experience as ur regular customer.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Too slow processing\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very slow laptop I bought it bcoz of i3 proc...but my pc with pentium core is more faster than this...I could be due to some settings or something other but the fact is\n&#34;,
 &#39;Goodproduct\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is bad\n&#39;,
 &#34;Battery is not removeable where it was written removable and the system is good but slow in working overall it&#39;s good\n&#34;,
 &#39;Get  good condition system,  some  times little  slow, other wise goodone product.  One of demerit is No any drivers and  software  CD in the box. Received  only charger  and  laptop in the box\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very bad product for hp very slow process and very bad customer service\n&#39;,
 &#39;Windows 10 works very slow with 4gb configuration. Better to have 8 gb. Build wise it is ok fr 30k range laptop. Or go fr 4gb without os and get win7\n&#39;,
 &#34;I&#39;m truly satisfied with the performance of the laptop and the battery backup especially considering the cost I paid for this.Also, GET 10% CASHBACK + 6 Month Extended Warranty In this Laptop by Ordering through vqr .in/1Hope this helps!

 &#34;Wonderful product for such a price. I got it for an effective price of nearly 17,000 ₹ and I&#39;m delighted to have it.Pros -- Good battery life. Lasts for around 4 hours.- Lightweight.- Doesn&#39;t lag.- Price is great.- Trusted brand.- Durable and excellent for daily use.Cons -- Not suitable for high end gaming.- It is DOS, hence you&#39;ve to install Windows by yourself.\n&#34;,
 &#39;damage laptop received.. very disappointment.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought it for my personal use &amp; i&#39;m surprised how it performs. It&#39;s super lightweight though battery backup isn&#39;t good, might last for 2 hours after a full charge. Switching between tasks is super smooth &amp; no lags even when lots of windows are opened. This is where AMD quad core processor shows its jalwa. I installed windows 10 &amp; it&#39;s working awesome. At this price point its supercool product. I got it next day because i&#39;m a prime subscriber. Others might get it late. Go for it, its a jackpot.Note: do check if its covered by hp warranty because in past many people have faced the issue with hp products bought from Amazon. Hp guys say they wont provide warranty for any product bought from Amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;its not working properly i need to return the laptop urgently , there are lines on the display of laptop, it did work 10 days only. after that we are facing a lot of problems with it, can you please my product or take return, i am requesting you to take return or get repaired .  how can we get warranty of laptop from HP company ,where we go to get repaired.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Lightweight. HP laptop in less than 20K is worth a deal.The only gripe: I bought in offer period, and noticed that the price changed after offer period to a lower one. Not fair Amazon !The warranty was already found to be updated to the month i bought (Sep) of 2018.Was easy to install softwares.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is fine, working good except Bluetooth. Tried all of the drivers from HP downloads. The seller shipped faster. Tried Drivers of Realtek, HP, Broadcom &amp; intel.\n&#39;,

 &#34;Amazon delivered a product which was manufactured 2 years ago. I received October 2016 product on 16 October 2018. VGA, USB and HDMI ports are already rusted.Moreover, as per their policies, I will have to coordinate with technician to inspect the product so that complaint can be raised. Product photos aren&#39;t sufficient.As per HP website, the warranty was started in June 2018.Will update on basis of response I receive from Amazon.\n&#34;,
 &#39;demaretsthis product is not for those who dont know to how to install window and driversit is an humble request to amazon to atleast provide network driverand even the product detailed mentioned on the laptop and actual details of the product is differenti also dont recieve any product detailed voucher in the boxusb port of one side is not working , kindly tell me which driver should i install for thatmeritsbettery life is fair easily last for 4 hoursfunctioning are smoothoverall good after installing the window\n&#39;,
 &#39;Daily work is fine and super M.s office very smoothly run abd other games non of these i really love this mini laptop you got a 18k price range i recommend this laptop best and hp brand Like - this performance is equal to core i3 Amd a6 proffeser is very very good - i think amd a6 equal to core i3 so i suggested go for order it\n&#39;,
 &#39;After Use Of 1 Year As Developer Good For Basic Programming But Not For Framework.Build Quality Is Awesome.Mostly Use Linux Os(Ubuntu, Linix Mint) . This Os Work Faster Better And Smoother As Compared To Windows 10\n&#39;,
 &#39;Again bitter experience from amazon. CD/DVD Writer is not working properly. Noise from hard disk\n&#39;,
 &#39;Lap not turning on any solution?\n&#39;,
 &#39;I am really very happy with this product.But, the Sound from the device is not audible.Packing - betterThis is my first purchase with Amazon Thank you so much!!!Best product best price\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good laptop atleast right now I don&#39;t have any issues, great budget laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This laptop with AMD processor is low budget home use laptop come with DODPreinstalled  os you have to install win 10 64bit os and download the necessary drivers from HP web site.It&#39;s moderate laptop for using net surfing other office work. Display is moderate and low end hamming can run in this laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is a very good budget laptop. I bought this for my dad. Hardware spec are just right for daily basic usage, office apps, movies etc. Screen is good quality. Viewing angle is better than most lappys in this budget.Thing to remember. This doesn&#39;t come with OS. Also it lacks bluetooth. But you can go for a ₹200 bluetooth USB adapter and work with it.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Build quality is good. Battery exhaust fast . AMD processor is a bit slow. Once you buy you can&#39;t return  cab be replaced on , so check it before buying.  Overall not so Happy\n&#34;,
 &#34;Not even 06 months completed. It&#39;s battery became non functional. Laptop doesn&#39;t work without electricity ON. Tried to claim under warranty but HP denied for the claim. Worst experience ever.This may be due to design of battery. (Protrusion of battery from the even surface)Laptop&#39;s overall functioning is good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its a good buy for small business. Have bought 2 of them till now and have been using it over a week. The touchpad is excessively smooth which might be difficult for few to use. No lags..Works like any other intel processor. Go for it..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Well at 19k i cannot expect an alienware..serves what its meant for..very average mousepad..and ordinary battery..display is great but sometimes windows trips..better get an original window..\n&#39;,
 &#34;This laptop doesn&#39;t work and when it switch on it can&#39;t work anymore\n&#34;,
 &#34;Just what I needed at the Price which doesn&#39;t hurt the pocket! Secondly, HP reliability for assurance\n&#34;,
 &#39;I have just used laptop for one day after receiving.Laptop came with Battery and adapter in double sealed box.Only DOS installed .Drivers and other apps needs to be downloaded.Nice look.No laptop bag supplied.overall good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Cant handle multiple applications\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is good. But when it comes to warranty the seller is always on the back seat. I got warranty only for 10 months. Many times i contacted this seller but no response ftom him.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a good product... now I m using it for almost 4 months now.Nice product and awesome working speed\n&#34;,
 &#39;The screen has developed some lines and have contacted Amazon several time. HP has denied any support on this. I am feeling extremely cheated on this. This is inspite of a senior leadership team calling me back and giving several assurances that it will get sorted in 4-5 days.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Everything is good ...but u have to pay extra for installing windows and antivirus for outside ...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Super laptop, Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice productAndNice priceThanks Amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is good for this price. But RAM information is not correct. I am going to try and upgrade it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fast work.Awesome battery backupAnd the most interesting thing is- its fast charging.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s recommended as per it price range. Works Fine and couldn&#39;t expect more in this price range\n&#34;,
 &#34;i&#39;ve been using this laptop for 2 years.....i&#39;m jus using it for my basic purpose only like for studies, watching movies etc.. for that it performs well until today...good product at cheaper price\n&#34;,
 &#34;Ok but screen quality not perfect and screen bar line&#39;s came but prasents one scratches lines displays\n&#34;,
 &#39;Fast, lightweight, easy to use, appropriate RAM, screen, storage space. Very suitable for students, working professionals looking for a lightweight performance laptop\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have received a chapati stone instead of laptop. My goodness I opened in front of courier person. Plz don&#39;t believe much on online product which cost more than RS. 5000/-. Delivery also not satisfied.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Amazing products have been using for last few months for every day(long hours)....it&#39;s a wonderful all in one product within this budget....\n&#34;,

 &#39;You just need to buy/install the Windows 10 and it works perfectly. Not recommended for any person who does not know how to install new OS.- A6-7310 is better than 3rd/3th gen i3 processors- Build quality is good at this price range.- No back-light for keywords, so be aware of the same.- It has Optical drive, VGA Port, HDMI, 3X USB, SD Card reader, Bluetooth, Camera- 3.5 mm headphone jack is awesome, as you can simply plug your mobile headphone and even mic will work.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product for 19k.. no issues with the processor or hardware.. I ve been using it since 3 months.. good for students. But the problem is that driver software for usb 2.0 ports unavailable in hp software site.. i had to download lenovo drivers to make it work.. no any other issues..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wifi connection is not activated even after several times drivers installation. My all efforts are gone in drain and still not it is not working. Online HP help center still.unable to fix this issue. Waiting for the service man to visit personally and fix it.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Based on a week&#39;s experienceGood product for the price.Using Ubuntu 16.04Pros:1. Decent amount of RAM: Almost all regular progs runs smoothly. Some heavy files eats up memory though.2. Good graphics: Runs steam based Hitman (2016) game. Though it is expected with A6 APU.3. Decent build4. Good battery backup. Gives around 3 hrs backup when streaming videos with wired internet.5. No problem with cooling till now. Let&#39;s see how it holds up in summerCons:1. An hour more of battery backup would have been great2. 14 inch screen is a little small.For now my verdict is that it is a very decent laptop for the price.\n&#34;,
 &#39;worst built quality i have been using this since last 3 months it  is got a crack near the keyboard and also the battery locks are not working properly(one of them is not working et al)\n&#39;,
 &#39;Within two months the mother board got damaged. It was replaced under warranty but the next day cooling fan stopped working. Raised a case and waiting.Edit: Cooling fan was also replaced under warranty. So promoting the rating to two. But now the OS crashes (blue screen) very frequently (twice a day); not sure if it is a hardware or software issue.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Really awesome product,in this price range. I&#39;ve been using this from last couple of days and I didn&#39;t face any lagging issue neither heating issue. I would recommend if your budget range is between 20k\n&#34;,
 &#34;I bought this from Amazon and using since last one month. Till the time no issue found with this machine. Anti glared screen is great and also smoothly works with all applications. I am using Windows 10. Bettary back up is also appreciated it&#39;s about 4 to 5 hours for continues  use. Very light weight and slim. As per budget it fulfills all the requirements.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop is delivered within 3 days without prime, thanks seller.Product is very cheap and good performance. Touchpad is not responsive smoothly in windows 7. Overall excellent.For better performance replace HDD into SSD and upgrade RAM to 8gb or 12gb or 16gb.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I buyed this laptop on Axis Bank Credit Card with 24 months EMI. But my first credit card bill with this product EMI includes the complete amount into the statement. Bank says the seller got delayed into converting the amount into EMI and the complete amount is generated in the credit card bill. Whoever has delayed but now I&#39;m in a fuss.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Its a very good product, good value for money. I have been using for 3 months. It doesnt have keyboard light, so using it in dark is a problem. Bt other than than everything is covered. Good for basic uses, even programs also can use. Not good enought for android development cause its amd cpu, arm based system image is very slow.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product which has been sent to me has a defect that the left side 2 usb device connector is not working at all which is used for the connection of a pendrive, charger or like wise device. As the time of return has been passed  even I can not replace  it now. So what can be described more, it is looking very nice but it just extinguishes the fire of my enthusism.\n&#39;,
 &#34;After researching a ton, I settled on this laptop. Don&#39;t let the price fool you. It is solid. I added an extra 4gb of ram to the laptop and now it flies. For those interested...it has 2 RAM/DIMM SLOTS but only 1 is used (4gb) the other is free to add an extra dimm to. also make sure you use DDR3L (low voltage) as im not sure the regular DDR3 voltage would be motherboard compatible...the stock dimm was a Hynix DDR3L 4gb (hynix is hyundai&#39;s electronic division). Boot up on win 10 x64 bit is 7 seconds max. The extra ram really makes the computer zip through processes. I&#39;ve had no heat issues, and no glitches so far after a month of use. I love the weight/solid finish with a pseudo brushed metal type of artwork around the touchpad areas. It doesn&#39;t feel like cheap plastic. The AMD A6 is one of the best processors and has a great long life if you take care of them well. I have an older A6 dual core that is still running well after almost 6 years. Of course you have to clean your laptops vents from dust and keep it in a cool place and your AMD A6 will serve you well!. Don&#39;t waste your money on an overpriced INTEL I3 i5 etc generation processor...its a complete waste of money. Plus intel has had lawsuits in the past over faulty soldering of processors (just google it).... The only things I didn&#39;t like were that the keyboard is fused into the laptops&#39; moulding which makes cleaning the keyboard harder (thankfully i bought a keyboard protector but still this should be designed better as a removable keyboard), the screen is ok and it is great that it is anti-glare (matte finish) by default but dont expect an IPS HD screen at this price point. This is more for presentations/students/moderate office work stuff...I haven&#39;t tried gaming on it but I wouldn&#39;t expect a high FPS on this laptop.Finding drivers for this pc is a bit of a pain...but it can be done....first install the HP Support assistant and follow along as it checks your pc drivers and warranty etc...or you can look for a similar HP laptop with a similar chipset....and use the drivers from its support page....like the HP 15g 221au drivers some of them work for this pc .....Oh forgot to mention as an audiophile you will love this laptop&#39;s sound quality (speakers are located on the bottom where you&#39;re wrists usually rest....but the DTS sound application along with the REALTEK sound driver (they make the best sound cards imo as a long time user).....will blow you away...don&#39;t expect solid thumping bass as its unrealistic to do that...but the sound clarity and volume loudness is very good compared to other laptops....put in a good set of over the ear headphones and play with the DTS settings....(which turn off the default generic windows equalizer) and you will be amazed at the sound clarity and bass produced via the DTS application.the webcam is really good and great to do basic skype or photo snaps with....This computers bios if I remember correctly also allows VT (virtualization technology) so those interested in virtual machines or other simulation software would be able to do it with this...The DVD drive is a slim dvd writer....with a small profile and quiet when spinning/readingIt has a Rj 45(lan port), vga port, hdmi port 1x usb 3.0 port, and 2x usb 2.0 ports Touchpad is responsive but not made by synaptics (Elan touchpad) which is a bit of a downer as synaptics makes the best touchpads....but this gets the job done still.....no issues with trackspeed or movement...Bluetooth is very good uses the realtek chipset and connects on the first shot...no issues there...realtek wifi chip is very good as well...can get signal from 3 floors down (in a concrete house with rebar and several walls btw) you just need to make sure you get a good wifi driver for the card to work really well as the default windows driver only gives like 1 bar whereas the realtek driver gives you 4-5 bars of signal strength.....plus settings you can manipulate via device manager/control panel....I recommend getting this laptop if you are on budget and also buying a keyboard protector (saco brand makes it)....sure this laptop is about 2 years old in terms of chipset (probably mid 2015 to 2016 in terms of the AMD A6 7333 but at the price point along with what comes with it in terms of ports and chipsets its well worth it! Go buy it!If this review was helpful please click the LIKE / HELPFUL button! Thanks! :)\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great laptop for the prize. Will give it a five stars if it was delivered with Windows 10 installed\n&#39;,
 &#34;Took 3 days for delivery. Laptop is not the best and there is a noticeable lag here and there. But, in this price range, it is the best you can get. Battery life is superb and you can use it for most softwares.... Don&#39;t buy it if you use heavy coding softwares. Otherwise for normal company use, it is good.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very bad.never expected to have such a very bad display.far behind average display.regret this buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;AMD A6 is better than i5 processor buy it without any doubtTested Games:NFS MW 2.0Far Cry 3Prototype 2Pes 2017Sniper elite 3Mass effect 3\n&#39;,
 &#34;No problem in Win 10 64 bit installation. DisplayBrightness a little  bit lowered after Catylist driver installation.Battery draining fast on web browsing. All HSE Comp.Sc/App tools functions smoothly. Installed MS office,Gimp,Geany,GCC compilar,Libre office,SQL,PHP,&amp; ApacheRecently installed Ubuntu 16.04 LTS to make a dual boot system. Grub update on terminal brings the dual boot screen. Running flawlessly in Ubuntu too.Low brightness problem in win 10 is also resolved with AMD&#39;s display driver configuration\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good OneIf you are not a gamer then its a best choice for you in this price range. Every thing works fine at moderate use. I must recommend to every body and the seller is also good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Absolute value for money if you want a budget model. It has high speed hard disk and is listed as a business laptop in HP website. Performs well for the price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Satisfied for the price paid\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good productShould include some accessories like bagAnd include some cabel like HDMIBy the way good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;The display of the laptop is not good after installing the driver the picture quality seems like the display is grainier and jazzy.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent product within decent price bracket. Performance is excellent can be improved with higher ram. Good battery backup 4-5 hours*/depends upon individual usage.\n&#39;,
 &#39;2 ports are not working...speed also not upto the mark\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice laptop for home use .\n&#39;,
 &#34;So its been 3 days with this laptop an i have no complaints so far yet there are some stuffs that could have been better and done well. let compare each aspect of this laptop one by oneBUILDi bought this laptop to carry it when am in a vacation or outdoor most and in this part i have to say its a firm one and light weight but what i noticed is the whole this feels so plastic. there is enough place to rest you hand while typing but i really felt the need of keypad back light when i was doing my work in dark. the top has some really good texture with hp logo. though there are three USB port but none is 3.0. there are led lights for both webcam, on the right side of the the laptop coupled with HDD led notification and surprisingly LAN port light.on the right side there is our usual CD reader and writer. keypads are tactile and clicky. on the front side there is card reader and on the left there is 3.5mmjack and HDMI and at the back u can swipe back the battery from the down sidePERFORMANCEi bought this laptop for my daily coding and making presentation and stuffs. with AMD A6 and G4 Radeon i didn&#39;t so any lags our massive slow downs. though i strongly recommend that heavy software like ADOBE and games like GTA 5 should be left out.yet it is to be considered that since its AMD some compatibility issues with emulators is expected(updated) i have not yet installed any antivirus so far since defender seems to be pretty good. yet after installing adobe photoshop it started lagging. games like company of heroes tend to lag a littleSTANDBYbattery tend to lag 3 to 4 hours depending on the usage though i have an average opinion about the battery.it can be detached by sliding two locks at the back bottom of the laptop and pulling the pipe battery out.SCREENscreen seems to be bright enough with anti glare which seems to be good outside though sunlight shooting straight may create difficultyCAMERAit is equipped with  a one mega pixel camera with a microphone which is quite a decent one. it is good when photo is taken in enough lighting but when it comes to low light it is prone to distortion. it is sufficient for video chatsSPEAKERspeaker are bedded at the bottom front of the laptop which i would rate 6 out of 10. they are audible finely when there are no noise but when you are outside with disturbance they are not audible at allVERDICTthis laptop is good for its compactness.if you are an average user and need to do productive works like working on excel sheets or make presentation this is a fine choice. the only say i have is about the plastiky finish and performance which when considered with money seems OK\n&#34;,
 &#39;the screen is awesome, anti glare, the battery life decent and the keyboard is good. Slight heating on the bottom but not much although summers yet to arrive. Sound is very good, overall at this price point, excellent\n&#39;,
 &#39;Cheaply Build. The Plastic is brittle. Lags like your grandmother. It takes forever to open windows.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop &amp; card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just few days but in love with the product ... its light and i like the large fonts on the keypad ... pre installed windows 10 and its easy to set up .. I m Loving IT ;)\n&#39;,
 &#39;initial impression is excellent...light weight,thin,travel friendly.Super fast booting,due to ssd. hop this laptop last long.lets see what happen due to corse of time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Item as described, super fast delivery. Will review the laptop after a few weeks of use.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fast performanceWosrt display\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy\n&#34;,
 &#39;Great Product at a great price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slim ,light weight easily carry in traveling.Good battery time.....Min 5hrsFor office use best one.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is fast, good for regular office/home work.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The Laptop has a decent display, boots fast and does what it should for the price. However, the Microsoft Office mentioned in the listing is a 30-day trial version. However, the vendor conveniently mentions that Microsoft Office is available without providing any hints that it is a trial version.When I called up Amazon Customer Support. I was told -1. The Product only has a 30-day trial and that this has been clarified in an User Answer. There are 4 products and 3 user answers. Completely not appropriate2. I was asked to purchase the license for 8k.This is a complete cause of Deceptive Advertisements by the vendor.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have received it today only.. Done basic set up. Original windows 10 &amp; Ms office 2019(Life Time).System is pretty fast in terms of booting.Those who are complaining about Ms office 2019 for 30 days, first understand how to activate Ms office 2019....1. First create your own outlook I&#39;d like how we are creating in Gmail, Yahoo....2. Then Left side bottom search box, just type  Excel and click the Excel.3. It will ask you to activate.. just click activate and enter your outlook username and password, what you have created or already having.4. Enjoy for life time..5. Meanwhile don&#39;t click office 365, bcz its not for life time...I hope you will enjoyReview after 15 daySystem is superb. It&#39;s very fast in terms of opening Ms office,GC,IE... No lagging...Those who complaining about hanging... Update the system even bios also...Once it&#39;s done you won&#39;t find the lag...Meanwhile don&#39;t expect the speed when you&#39;re booting first time...31/10/19 updateWhen I clicked ❓in the right bottom, opened HP page. Where I got the 4 updates. It seems, it&#39;s very important update for bios, Bluetooth, lan and wifi. Those who are complaining system is slow, this update may helpful...\n&#34;,
 &#39;Dont buy this, in 3 months  of time, hard disk conked off.Laptop is pretty slow .Have to incur an expense of 5k to get a new hard disk.Amazon should have a larger period of return window for sensitive products like laptop.Actually  a loss to buy this laptop from the seller.Better to go with offline stores like Croma or exclusive dealer of the brand.\n&#39;,
 &#34;8GB RAM + 256 GB SSD + i3Windows 10 HomeMS Office Home and Student - Lifetime ( Word + Excel + PP + OneNote )MS Office 365 - One month trialThe above features are good for this price, I got this for 28KGood for Coding and browsingthe boot time is very fast, thanks to the SSD - use your space well, Don&#39;t dump unnecessary files in your PCVery lightweightBattery backup - GoodVideo quality - Good - Integrated graphicsNot great for gamingMy Verdict - If you want a PC for coding and browsing stuff, this one is the best in the budget- No lags literallyBuy a good external drive HDD to store the stuff like movies, songs etc..Screen Quality - decentBattery Life - Very GoodLight weight\n&#34;,
 &#39;This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price. Overall just a fine product for browsing but not more.\n&#39;,
 &#34;From the reviews, I purchased this laptop only to regret it later. I contacted amazon for return but they told me a 10-12 step solution to make laptop faster which I implemented. The laptop did become a tad bit faster but returned to being the speed of the first generation computers in the world.Now I am frustrated using it and would highly recommend to not buy this laptop.I don&#39;t know if Amazon can help here. My INR 30000 wasted in this utter disappointment of a product.\n&#34;,
 &#39;superb laptop with win10, ms office, all preloaded and 8gb RAM/ 256 GB SSD. Very quick to boot and no lag. Dropbox giving 27GB space free with this and One drive gives 5 gb space So all one needs is an extended warranty ( bought for 1500 on Amazson) and a optional Pendrive ( bought a 64 GB) for storing documents etc. Bought in exchange so paid Rs.23,236 ( Rs.4760 for old Sony Viao plus some SBI card discount), so really happy with my purchase. Good screen and battery backup. Only miss not having a backlit keyboard, rest all is great!\n&#39;,
 &#34;The HP laptop, 14 inch, light weight and genuine softwares is a perfect combination for anybody who is in search for a decent laptop.After couple of days of working, here is what I found,Pros:1. Windows 10 &amp; MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I&#39;ve reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.\n&#34;,
 &#34;In the first 20 days mouse was not working had to open the laptop and got fixed easily but what&#39;s the point? Also I beleive the HP quality is gone down. This laptop screen  does not open much its just till 90 degree. Also the original pro e shown is high and then it make you feel as if they are giving you high discount but it&#39;s the actual price.. Not happy with the quality\n&#34;,
 &#39;Do not buy hp products... Service is just waste.. To replace a faulty part already 20 days over without any further updates.. This is my experience and if you buy it.. You can experience it also..\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have taken this laptop 3 months back, and it was quite horrible in the beginning.The speed was so slow that even I needed to wait around 30-40 secs to open a small size excel file. I even tried contacting hp but did not get much help as it was screen sharing session.I consulted one of my friend to it, he helped me out in increasing laptop&#39;s speed, he actually removed all unwanted/unnecessary software which were pre installed. Like, McAfee (Not needed when you already have built in Windows defender), some unwanted game software and then he did fragmentation in order to utilize space holes in memory.It really worked and I am able to use the software which I need in a quick of time.You can try this to increase the system performance. Hope this will help you out!\n&#34;,
 &#39;This is one of the best laptop in this price range, also there is some confusion related to MS office trail version, i purchased this laptop 2 days back and i conform it has MS office 2019 student version for life time free.Just go for this!!!!!!!!!\n&#39;,
 &#39;I hate the thing that in the ad they say Microsoft Office is free where as it is a silly one month trial for that its not worth it far more better options available please either provide the lifetime MSO or else my order is up for return\n&#39;,
 &#39;I am a software professional and I like this product for its light weight and faster booting time. However I can not like its camera quality. it is very poor. After 4 days when I booted it started its own updating of BIOS straight from HP and for reasons I could not understand . At the same time its OS windows updated itself which is not a surprise. Some of its claimed features like integrating with my mobile on an instant basis is NOT happening even after several attempts by me , which is not surprising considering Windows commercial nature and its cunning features. I do not know  for what reasons but sometimes it suddenly loses its contact to internet by wi-fi which feature  I am  using on regular basis as a default one. I bought it because its has MS OFFICE which updates itself because it has come loaded with it. Otherwise Microsoft breaks your computer if you had loaded it from your friends CD. I tis very fast ,very light and jet black colour is very attractive. Arrived one day before in good condition but they should have supplied a bag for free.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Pros:-Really nice laptop-Quite fast. Boots in less than 10 seconds.-Screen quality is decent.-Battery last more than 6-7 hours on medium brightness. Average usage-Sound is satisfactory.-Value for moneyCons:-Cheap plastic body. I am scared to carry anywhere.-In less than 1 month, print on keys is faded. Poor quality print.-Webcam quality is pathetic. It&#39;s like a vga camera-Adapter is heavy. Almost weighs 70% weight of laptop. Beats the purpose of portability.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Thin and light weight , this laptop is quite good . Performance is also good. Windows 10 work smooth. The set up is automatic and very easy. The display is not that great but for the price point quite acceptable. Overall a good buy.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Display very poor qualityBuild quality poor just poor plasticKeyboard not so softPerformance averageAs a brand HP it&#39;s look like so poorIf you are paying 27k or 29k for this laptop you should go some higher range laptop with good full hd display if IPS is the best.If looking for normal work go with lower range with less RAM but you will better display keyboard and build quality.But don&#39;t buy this display is jerk.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Pro: In exchange i got this lappy with i3 7th gen, 256gb ssd, 8gb ram and original win10 &amp; ms offic, weight 1.4kg @ ₹24200/-. In this price i consider it worthy of purchase. Looks of the laptop is also good.Cons: Poor web cam, Screen quality is not good, its avg, not backlight keyboard &amp; speaker doesnt produce bass much.Overall all looking at price and the hardware specs i m very happy. Photoshop &amp; video editor works fine. Good for student &amp; office going people. I switched from asus x200ma to hp 14q.As per configuration of this hp 14q its really fast. Boots up in 2-3sec.\n&#39;,
 &#39;its been almost 4 hours I am using this Laptop and trust me I am loving every bit of it, its handy, looks cool, sleek, its beautiful, its light yet super fast. battery charges quick tons of good things, 256GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM are the main highlights the only thing that could have been better is the screen but then its under 30000 so not a big deal HD+ display is still good enough.thumbs up and thank you HP, thank you Amazon.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Didn&#39;t worked like new laptop even 1 day . From the date of purchase it didn&#39;t worked well as it has very very slow performance and i contacted hp support many times but they did nothing and i myself tried to reset it and failed then gone to hp care and thry said that window is corrupted u have to pay rs. 400 for cloud recovery, i have to pay for service even in warranty,wtf is this?? Worst experience with hp. If you face u any problem on 1st or second day then pls return it. Other wise u will get irritated from hp service.😑\n&#34;,
 &#39;I bought this laptop especially for the reason that it had MS Office included. Apparently, the procedure to activate MS office is to call HP customer care and they will take the remote connection and activate it.Its been 2 weeks since laptop is delivered and I have made some 10+ calls to HP customer care each of which is of 30 min+ duration and still, the MS office is not activated yet.Terrible experience after buying a brand new laptop from HP.\n&#39;,
 &#39;For the price this is the best SSD laptop one can find buying a laptop with an HDD is just naive when u can get tons of storage using an external drive. The screen is also decent and much better than I expected but would have preferred a full HD display. Battery life is poor as one gaming session drains the battery low. The laptop is quite light and comfortable to use. The camera is poor to say the least.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Been using it since 1week and its working fine. Display is good, sound quality is superb, takes a few seconds to boot and it functions very quick and smoothly because it has ssd which is the biggest plus point. I didn&#39;t find the battery life very long lasting but it gets charged soon. It met my requirements both in work and entertainment purpose. Overall its a go for it product at this price range.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent value for money. Super fast boot thanks to ssd. i3 processor 8 gb ram 256 gb ssd.. Win 10 os.. Ms office 2019 home and student included.. Great deal!!\n&#39;,
 &#39;Unbelievable laptop, for this price point there is no match available. Sleek, light weight, super fast. No point spending large sum of money on other brand. This by far one of the best product for this price.\n&#39;,
 &#39;CONS -Its just a day old laptop but start showing its signature of slow processing..It takes more time than usual to start and shut the PC and also sometime it slows down in responding to the Feed Input.Display Quality - I m bit worried about the display quality as gentle press at the back of display can be seen on Display with merge of color at the spot (when pressed).Pros -Battery life is Quiet Good (upto 5-6 hours) N can be Fully charged in 1.5 hoursSpeaker Quality is GoodLight in Weight n Compact in SizeI will rate it 3.5 Star based on 2 days of Usage.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Build quality is great and super thin laptop. I got this in 1 day andPros:SSD M.2 NVMe PCIe type8 GB Ram DDR4Core i3 7th Gen with 3MB Cache3 cell batterySuper thin body and lightweightCons:No fingerprint ( Not mandatory required to everyone)No Type C port ( Very few people use as type c to type c cable are not common)Lookwise it is simple.Recommend!\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product ie i3 laptop two numbers i got from you is not working properly.  Speed also very poor.  Only security window opens then only curser visible.  Window screen not opens .  I wish to return the products\n&#39;,
 &#34;See....this laptop is not for watching movies, gaming etc...you can use it for day to day work and it will work really fast and good... specially when it&#39;s super fast while window is starting and shutting down...8 Gb RAM and 256SSD is doing the stuff...DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DOING THE HEAVY USAGE... KEEP IT SIMPLE\n&#34;,
 &#34;This is the new model by HP and got the deal in Great Indian Festival at 29,990. No issues in Warranty, Windows 10, Office. All are original. Laptop boots in 5-7sec due to its SSD feature.If you are planning to buy a laptop for delicate purposes like office work, watching movies, youtube, listening music, this is the perfect choice. Don&#39;t go with normal HDD laptops, it will be slower afterwards because of its mechanical functionality.I will modify my review after 7 days of usage.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Please don&#39;t buy this Model. It&#39;s just waste of your money. I bought this with so much expectation but all gone. Only 2 things are good in this one is light weight and other is battery life rest nothing to tell.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Well the laptop is quite good. Battery life is average... It lasts about 4-5 hours. It is amazingly light. Laptop looks very premium. Processing is also good. But it is ideal for casual use. No problem is faced during web browsing, watching movies, editing documents, etc. Overall it is a good one. And of course it is &#34;value for money&#34;.\n&#39;,
 &#39;After seeing lots of positive and negative reviews I decided to purchase this one. Its working fine. Battery back up good, screen display good, easy to carry because of small size and lightweight. Faster because of having SSD. Overall satisfied.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Operating sysytem is little bit slow..... Reboot tine takes time.Body quality is soft and not firm like dell.One has to handle with care. Battery life is good and sound also good.But price wise the product is ok....\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not a good product at all. Very slow. Ram cannot be upgraded over the 4gb slot. Lots of issues in slowness and had to call HP technician to take a look at it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is nice laptop.All functions available like MS office with lifetime validity..Sound quality is very superb .I think HP should be preferred over Dell laptop.simple 4 start for performance.Highly recommended for Home use and normal routine work this is best laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have purchased the best product available globally, but am not able to use it. Obviously, there is nothing wrong with the product, however, however, it is lying unused. I am sure team HP will feel eqully bad if not worse for the product lying unused in a remote corner of the Globe. But, like it or not, this is a STARK FACT STARING us in the face.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Microsoft office (Excel,word, PowerPoint)is lifetime valid. Don&#39;t open office at first- create a Microsoft outlook id and the. Login with that, otherwise u get only trial version.Screen is average,speed excellent boots in seconds. Light weight easy to carry is the highlight.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very good product. Thin and lightweight.  Battery backup is very good. I am writing this review after using the product for more than two weeks.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Got an awesome deal on Amazon Great Indian Sale. The laptop is compact with awesome performance at this price point. The inclusion of an SSD is an added attraction since the boot time is just 10 secs.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Go for it ...Ms office lifetime available without any chargesWindows 10 orginal ( i.e full security)Portable and light weight with average screen quality😉\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a very light weight and travel friendly laptop. It process fast and has good memory space. It can be used by professionals working on basic applications such as MS office. This system also turns to be college friendly. It has a smooth keyboard and the video quality also seems to be good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow and keeps hanging. Only for regular student work and doesn’t involve huge applications. The HP service is very bad. Though displays on-site warranty they insist to run around to service center. Don’t recommend to buy this product at all.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Laptop is very fast with 8 GB RAM and SSD. Response is fast even when using multiple software&#39;s. Battery gets 100% in 45 minutes and gives backup for 6-7 hours. Screen quality is good. Good laptop for office and research work in sub 30k price.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Laptop is very slow and hangs in between. Dont buy. I have never used such a bad laptop ever in my life. I wish I could return it within time limit. Wasted my money\n&#39;,
 &#39;I really wanted a laptop which will be fast enough to run multiple programs but not games.This product is perfect for me\n&#39;,
 &#39;Seller doest gave invoice in the packet, im doubting authenticity of the product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Excellent entry level notebook, the SSD is so much faster than a SATA. The build is okay.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Charger of the laptop is not working and no any helpline no. was provided for complain as well as service. However, the no. of available on the website of hp is not given response.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Pros: Light weight, good battery life, 4GB RAM and 1TB HDDCons: Processor speed slower than expected.Remark: Value for money.\n&#39;,
 &#39;System is pretty slow. Takes lot of time to boot.This is for basic usage of the laptop. Not worth for the money.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I have just received the product and MSO is not activated by HP. Also after 3hrs of online session still same thing. If in product it&#39;s mentioned that MSO is included then Why not pre-installed in it. Facing lot&#39;s of issues with service team. DELL is better in service\n&#34;,
 &#39;Vert worst service from hp asking for replacement not giving bad bad bad dont purchase from hp any more..... I purchase 2 qty paying 29000 ,,,they are least bother to help i would have taken frm retailpc is very very slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Light weight. Stylish. Good battery life. Fast chargingOnly issue little bit slow.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;New HP laptop is very slow... I haven&#39;t installed any applications yet but it&#39;s really slow.. I think I have gone back 20 years where we use to have very less ram.. having 4 gb ram and using application like word also works really slow\n&#34;,
 &#39;The 8GB ram and 256 SSD HD results in the laptop being extremely fast. Light weight. Easy and convenient for frequent travellers. Speakers are good for this price range.Value for money at 28k with SBI card discount.\n&#39;,
 &#39;A light weight laptop for routine use. Came loaded with Windows 10 and MS Office.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Light weight portable laptopSince SSD technology boots the system faster no lag while using multiple applications5 hrs of battery life I got with multi processing\n&#39;,
 &#39;It looks and feels premium and quite handy with its light weight. The screen is fabulous and the mouse pad has a soft touch. Overall in love with this machine. Opt for Office H&amp;S 2019 as it is only 1000 extra if bought along with the laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#39;The product is really good and value for money - reasonable price.However the vendor didn’t deliver MS office home edition license key. Awaiting the vendor to provide the same at the earliest.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Just after 15 days of receiving laptop it is not starting, please help on this, local repair said give back this laptop to AMAZON and product igot defects. Refer photo, it&#39;s not starting and requesting to replace the laptop\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very happy with the performance of the laptop... lightweight...good speed and worth the money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Viewing angles are worst.Option of Nvme m.2 SSD is good but not performing like.Overall performance is good, but it should be better in this price range.\n&#39;,
 &#39;No charger, operating system is very slow and no battery backupNot satisfied with the serviceVisited by technician and confirmed to returnWant my money back and wants to return the laptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;For the price, it is really good. real lightweight. Decent battery and screen. Very Good option option for basic computing/browsing needs.\n&#39;,
 &#39;A very good laptop.... 8 gb ram &amp; 256 ssd makes it fast and smoother... HD display &amp; battery backup upto 4 hrs... Good for students but not for gaming 😁\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery not goodSystem hangs many times\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good Buy. Solved my Requirement\n&#39;,
 &#39;A good pieceRAM needs to be enhanced\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen is very good and laptop gives 7 hr talk time and becouse of light weight i can take every where\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wish it was much faster but since this was for my kid, it works fine..!\n&#39;,
 &#39;purchased this in Amazon promotion (biggest mistake), laptop gets stuck and not able to click or type anything, Amazon not able to fix, neither returning the product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Shorter battery life, Cheap plastic build quality and bloatware are downside. Low price, comfortable weight are upside.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen quality is a let otherwise laptop is fast and responsive, happy with the purchase. Apps run smoothly without much hiccups.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have hardly loaded anything on my laptop. Just using it for basic MS office or Browsing, but Laptop is very slow. Its just a month old , but it hangs. Very disappointed with this product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice product. Excellent performance. Would have liked more if the hard drive is partitioned in two or three drives instead of a single drive.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Damaged product delivered. Scratches on one corner of the laptop. Laptop performance/speed is not okay. Tools long time for processing. Not satisfied with the laptop performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;Performance is good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Using the laptop since last 3 days although the look is average other features are good. It seems little slow however it is value for money.\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a very light  and compact pc you can take it to anywhere at office, college or on a journey. Beginners and for those who wants to learn ms office should go with this.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Wonderful product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Overall performance is good.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Recommended for home users it&#39;s has original windows and office 2019 student edition\n&#34;,
 &#34;It&#39;s a thin light weight laptop with a good configuration that we are in need. Useful for frequent traveller. It&#39;s worth for the money we spent.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good for daily use by students and professors for basic use. Thin n light weight. Good battery life. Thankyou Amazon for fast delivery\n&#39;,

 &#39;Scree quality is not good\n&#39;,
 &#34;I ordered this laptop on May 11 (Saturday) and the product reached to me early morning on May 13 (Monday), so kudos to Amazon&#39;s delivery! I was worried about any damages or scratches, but the laptop was well packed.Coming to the laptop, I&#39;m writing this review after using it extensively for 2 weeks. My review is divided into the pros and cons to cover all the features of this laptop:Pros:1) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.2) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.3) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.4) The touch is brilliant and extremely responsive. The inking pen has a quick response as well. If you&#39;re a designer, the inking pen can act as an added benefit, however, for me, it does not have any other utility than to play around with Paint 3D.5) Multifunctioning is smooth and the laptop doesn&#39;t lag or slow down when switching from one application to another.6) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.7) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.8) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.9) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.10) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn&#39;t feel any change in my typing speed.Cons:1) The screen- The screen is only HD and not FHD, so if you like watching 1080p videos, you won&#39;t get that full HD experience.2) There is no IPS or In-Plane Switching feature. The screen quality shifts with the slightest change, so you need to keep the screen in one angle to enjoy your video content. Even the slightest shift to the angel can lead to a change in contrast and black levels. So, not a comfortable experience overall.3) The volume is fine. It&#39;s not loud enough to play audios and videos for a large room full of people. You&#39;ll need a good speaker for your entertainment.4) The laptop heats up a lot when plugged into charging to a really uncomfortable level. You can&#39;t use the laptop on your lap while it&#39;s charging, especially in summers. I had to put the laptop in front of an Air Conditioner to cool it down a little.5) Though the laptop is sturdy, I&#39;d suggest you avoid using the 2-1 feature multiple times at once. (just saying)Overall, there are more pros than cons of this laptop. The biggest minus point for me is the screen. I focused on the 256 GB SSD and didn&#39;t pay heed to the screen resolution and IPS. But, It&#39;s a good buy and I&#39;m using it for both entertainment and work without any major concerns.This is a really good laptop if you wish to buy a 2-in-1 laptop and have a budget of 40-45k, but you can buy an FHD display with the 14-dh0101TU model that has the same specs as this one. I don&#39;t understand why the 101TU model wasn&#39;t launched with this and launched only a few days after it!\n&#34;,
 &#39;I bought it for my sister, she is a freelancer and I must appreciate the look first. I have used it for few hours and find so much comfortable in using, writing and overall accessibility of it. The built, texture and look of the laptop is quite premium. The touch screen is quick. It turns into a tablet very much quick and keyboards get disabled, so you don;t have to worry about keyboards getting pressed mistakenly while using it as a tablet.It is FHD, the visuals are good. The speed so far I have pretty much enjoyed.I recommend this laptop for students, freelancers, artists, writers and also good for traveling.It could be bit more lightweight but then, the cost must be high, so I give it that.the pen works cool. I am going to try more of it over the months, then see how it goes further.Overall, It is a must buy considering the price, brand, specifications, value for money and overall what you are getting here. If you want more specifications, you can go for i5 version or 8GB RAM version, but this model overall is cool\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is a preliminary review as I have just received the laptop and played on it for a day. It looks beautiful and slim. 2 in 1 looks very good, as a tablet with inking technology, it is amazing. Pen is good, it will be better to add a screen guard as we need to force the touch of the pen to the screen. This is my first i3 as I have always used i5 or i7, speed seems to be fine but have to see after loading bunch of software. SSD hard disk will be definitely a boost, planning to throw another 4gb ram stick to make it 8gb to compensate i3 performance. So far so good, will update later.First edit:It does not have backlit keyboard and modifying hardware like adding RAM or adding bigger SSD is very difficult in this model, just found all X360 hp laptops are compact and tightly packed like mobile phones. Battery is placed inside and could not be replaced easily like other or older hp laptops. This is definitely an inconvenience for people who are computer savvy and keep updating their laptops.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I think, It&#39;s a great deal and works like a charm. I was skeptical before buying this but overall it is a good buy if your budget is between 40k-50k as it comes with corei3 8th Gen,MS Office, Windows 10,360 degree, Tablet and touch screen with pen.. so what else we need..I did not feel any slowness as well so far.. However this review is based on 3 days of use.. so wait and see if someone is writing after a month.. but we can buy it👍\n&#34;,
 &#34;first thing first -performance of this machine is same as an i3 with ssd has to be -no complaints there. Its a Very good looking laptop. you will surely love it.But Biggest letdown is display. Let me tell you that if you are considering a laptop then look for full HD display.this one has HD display which provides so so images. The let down by display is visible all over.more to that the Glass on display is pathetic-as it reflects everything . It makes viewing so difficult that it keeps you annoyed all the time.i will update more as i get  more of it.UPDATE:- i am using it now for a considerable time.My biggest complaint was display and let me admit honestly that i am now used to it. i do not find it that annoying. But yes, i would still suggest to go for FHD laptop with few bucks more.Actually HP should have given FHD at this price point.(i bought this at 43K).Touch screen is gd. i am not using the Stylus at all,i think this will be case with every other customers. (samsung Galaxy Note owners know it well).the stylus -its there , because its just there,actual use is minimal.). So while purchasing don&#39;t get distracted with HP pen. its not an advantage unless you really require it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I m very much satisfied with laptop...fine touch screen....stylus pen working excellent........keyboard very sleek......video quality up to the mark...works very well for writing taking notes.....browsing is very fast....got it for 40700 on prime day\n&#39;,
 &#39;I got the laptop for 42990 which is a fair deal and as usual Amazon is awesome. First let me give you the cons.Cons:1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) the viewing angles could have been better.Now the pros:1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is inlclude.Overall worth it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Initially I had an issue with activation of Office. Very pleased with feedback provided on my review. Was able to activate MS Office. It does come with MS installed and usable. Hence changed the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.The unit is very lightweight. I was looking for a reasonably priced 2 in 1. Overall a very good value for money. The 4 GB of RAM seems a bit insufficient. Else, it serves my purpose of using the system mainly for documentation, spreadsheets and presentations. Yet to try out the pen..EARLIER INITIAL REVIEW.... Changed as above!!!By reading product details we get the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. The product details etc. are to be changed to clearly indicate this.Note: We just got the delivery last evening. The review will be changed if in case we find the activation key or if the seller provides the same.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Works like a charm on the very first day, hopefully it stays so, amazing looking lappy at an affordable price, go for it and pray for the guys we’re in good mood while packing it, just like for mine\n&#39;,
 &#39;With the best options for a student, with silent and fast flash-drive based operation, this is a great buy. We paired it with an external 21&#34; HP monitor and USB Keyboard/Mouse set to make it an excellent desktop at home and portable laptop away from home.. Legal Windows-10 and MS-office-home-student version makes it even more of a value proposition..\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased this laptop on 30 May and it was mentioned that its available with microsoft home in it but now outlook is showing unlicenced. What does it mean as i am unable to work with outlook? Everytime i open oultook it asks me to confirm my mail id and start with all the process of signing in.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased with good deal in exchange of old laptop.It is very nice built quality compared to my old laptop. Metal finish, looks premium. Light weight &amp; sleek.Boot time start and shut down time less than 5 sec, very fast because of SSD.Display, Mukti gesture trackpad, touchscreen  and pen use extremely useful. Speakers are good.Battery backup for video streaming is 7-8 hours and for mild to medium use gives at least 5 hours, Can use for a day with single charge.Genuine HP product, checked on website 1 year warranty.MS office included, needs activation only.SSD storage available is 212 gbOut of 4 gb ram, 2 gb already occupied but most of work done smoothly with slightly lagging.Cons - display is HD not FHD OR IPSNo Backlit keyboardNo fingerprints sensorOther 2 models available with overcoming this feature which cost 10k extra.Major plus point - SSD + ms office + 360 convertible + pen includedthis is best model in market if u get it around 30k, just go for it.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its fine, @ 42k its disappoiting why company omit backlid led keyboard.Licensed ms office ( outlook not bundled )Pen funtionality is not so great.Also mouse pad has a creaking noise. I made 2 attempt for replacement but no one processed my request.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s my first touchscreen laptop. But I&#39;ve handled apple products before. So the touchscreen (obviously) doesn&#39;t add up. But I am pretty satisfied with it&#39;s look and functionality. Battery doesn&#39;t last long though.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very Good Model for medium level users. Delivered the product one day  before actual predicted date.Booting speed is really good.  Only thing is that once you received the product,  you have to remove many apps which are really not required. Touch is of average quality.Got a very attractive price for the old model.\n&#39;,
 &#39;On 16th jul 19 received my hp pavilion able to switch on followed instructions next day when i switched on after providing pin blank screen is appearing.Lets c will i get some help. After which vl update\n&#39;,
 &#34;I brought this in primeday offer, after replacing my old laptop I got it in very low price which was never expected. Worth for price... But they mentioned as it has fingerprint scanner I&#39;m not able to find anywhere in the laptop. HP should increase RAM capacity and HDD capacity which will be more helpful.\n&#34;,
 &#39;\xa0The 360 feature is great and the laptop is so fast in performance. It appeals to the looks so much and you get the value you spend. The key board is super quick and smooth in function, little heavier though. HP always surprises with innovation and this product also amazed me though little lesser than my previous one I bought, spectre 😜\n&#39;,
 &#34;At best an average product. Turned up with dead pixels on screen when switched on out of box. HP support says to contact Amazon. Amazon agent sets up replacement but no-one turns up to collect it back. Better to buy directly from manufacturers website instead of Amazon or third party retailers as in case of any out of box issues you will be shuttling between the two without a resolution. Description says HD screen but colour is so dull looks like non HD. Windows HDR configuration setting doesn&#39;t detect HD screen. Buy it only if you want to shuttle between Amazon and HP and still have dissatisfaction.\n&#34;,
 &#34;Amazing Laptop. It is fast, touch is good, pen is working.It is completely worth buying. I think this is the best laptop at this price.Note: There is only one issue which is the battery doesn&#39;t work for more near to what hp claims. It is still very descent.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I would have bought it for 42490 but I bought it for 44490 saying it was lightning deal just rubbish.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Look wise and spec wise its a very good laptop. You may have to purchase external hard disc separately since this variant  comes with 256 GB but this is SATA.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I am using the product hardly for 5 days, I found rest thing is good but battery backup is really bad. It&#39;s just the start and after full charging the battery goes hardly 3-3.5 hours. I am worried going down the line how long it will work. The product claims to have a battery life of 5 hours, but it&#39;s not true.Not happy with battery :-\n&#34;,
 &#39;Got the product  with exchange if i3 laptop. Working fantastic.Mcafee purchased  after one month expiry.Rest windows 10 with ms office free. Fast response . Only constraint is 256 GB ssd. Thank u Amazon.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Touch screen and flexibility is the highlight which is available in other brands as well.Screen quality is not really good game put picture to understand better. Not visible from all angles.\n&#39;,
 &#39;By reading product details I got the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. Please check and confirm whether the office comes activated or not? Also, I tried following the instructions given in one of the reviews, but that would not help too. Kindly help regarding this issue asap!\n&#39;,
 &#34;Quite good product, received in a good condition. But don&#39;t know how to turn on the backlit of keyboard.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Any bad review to this laptop does not suit this awesome laptop most people think that touchscreen is a disadvantage but this laptop is finominal also great for gaming in mine craft when PC will be in PC mode though when you turn it into a tab it turns into pocket edition best laptop of all time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazing service , amazing delivery, quality product at best market price. Thanks .\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its a good product overall..but am finding the touchpad on the slower side even though i have increased its speed to the highest...rest very satisfied with the product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product received in damaged condition..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Received damaged product\n&#39;,
 &#39;A very handy lapbook for me, fast and worthy.Different kind of usb ports available so i can connect to many devices and with its windows and office installed its kind a great.\n&#39;,
 &#39;A good buy for this budget. Touch screen is awesome, so is the stylus response. Battery life is amazing. The screen is a little unstable and vibrates even in a fan. All in all, worth it!\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s broke. Very poor quality.  Even the services are not good and they are not replacing my laptop.  Pathetic  service Amazon\n&#34;,
 &#39;So far working excellent and loving it. Very user friendly.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best laptop in budget category with SSD drive, touch screen, 8gen i3 processor, light weight, 2in1 laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I am a lawyer so my usage is only for reading, research and drafting. I am really happy with the way this laptop has turned out to be in the first month of it&#39;s usage.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I really like the keyboard and touch screen of the laptop .the keyboard is spacious and the laptop bends complete 360 without any hassle or challenge . Battery backup is ok , not that great .\n&#39;,
 &#39;screen not working after four days of purchase.lets see if these guys will exchange it or not!!!. Sad\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worried about the product.as I have paid on the ordered date. When the lap reached me , started using it. I got the value worth for my money...... Thankful to Amazon\n&#39;,
 &#39;Amazing product\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy this product, my x360 is down from last 2 months, motherboard is not available and they refuse to change.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Nice and cool product..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product differs from the image. Model and product does not match. No finger print sensor on the model.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It was promised that the product will have a backlit keyboard but the keyboard doesn&#39;t has the feature. Beware of the fraud by #Amazon seller.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good battery life, fast booting and charging. Excellent for light user like me.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Worst decision ever to buy this laptop.Its very heavy and its looks are not same as it is shown in the pictures.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good product. Delivery time is very quick.\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is very good portable lalptop\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is really good. i am using it on daily and didnt find any issues so far..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Screen quality is worse. Not a worthy product at this price. Will not recommend\n&#39;,
 &#39;Nice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good  laptop as i was waiting for\n&#39;,
 &#39;Battery life is not satisfactory\n&#39;,
 &#39;everthing is great\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good and sleek\n&#39;,
 &#39;So far so good,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product was nice but suggest to go for either with 10th gen or fhd by keeping 2k\n&#39;,
 &#39;Performance is ok , but the audio output is very, it looks like a silent pc. Hp may kindly check sound issue.\n&#39;,
 &#39;i loved it..it gives awsm look and experience ..u can carry it like your phon..just fold it and go anywhere..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is quite good. Highly recommended to purchase.\n&#39;,

 &#39;This lap has many problems. I am trapped. Getting hanged every time I press right buttons.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good value for money. Fast due to ssd drive.\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s not working properly and taking too much time in opening any pc file\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good laptop in this price range.\n&#39;,

 &#39;A good buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;i like this laptop. it comes with good specifications for the price and also with a touch screen and a pen\n&#39;,
 &#39;Let me tell you a cautionary tale. I bought this laptop in late feb 2019. It has gone to the service centre thrice. It crashed in the third month. Motherboard crashed again in June. The system works now, but I have wait 15 min for it to start. The chrome doesn\&#39;t work. MS word crashes every other hour. If you decide to call HP, their people will repeat the catchphrases like, &#34; we are sorry&#34; &#34;let me connect you to somebody&#34;. That somebody will tell you that your system needs this or that- &#34; get your RAM upgraded&#34;. Then you will do that and system will crash again. You will call them again, and again and again, till you decide that it was your fault that you trusted HP.Moral of this Story:1. Never buy a HP Laptop2. Never believe a customer care person ( He /she has no clue !)3. Never trust HP service.4. Don\&#39;t fall for the touch and x360 gimmick. Its given so as to hide the fact that this machine doesn\&#39;t work !5. Finally, choose anything but HP.\n&#39;,
 &#34;\xa0I bought Hp Lapotp in June 2019 on amazon. Started having problems from start, complained to HP for attending defects ONSITE. they never came. Forced me to run to their service cenetr 25 km away. Then HP aksed me Rs 21,000 for Laptop under warranty ! HP website shows my laptop as &#39;expired warranty&#39;. Never Buy HP Laptops/PCs. HP doesnt honour warranty, makes customer run to their service center. HP has Customer relation Manager concept. If u got any problem and u r not satidfied with HP rpoduct, repairs etc, this man is the ONLY point of contact and he shall ensure that u cough out money for repairs as everything they put blame on customer.Inferior quality material is used for Base Panel and Hinges. Have been having DELL laptop for self and my company, DELL is just Excellent, any problem in their laptop, they just replace..They dont fight like HP. BEWARE, if u want to save 2-3K...u will end up crying.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Hp one of best laptop With Ms and windows 10 and 256 GB SSD. So fast and smooth.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t choose this laptop. It&#39;s worst. Within 6 months laptop display will be crashed and you will not get support from HP. Worst support from HP.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Osm yrr bahut zaberdast laptop hai but high graphic game mai thoda lod padta hai but yrr bahut stylish and osm yrr laptop ke sath ese fold kare tablet bhi bana skte hai bahut badiya 5out of 5..value for money this product.. Good agar aap lena ke soch rhe ho to jao le lo yrr kamal ka hai product hp.. Bahut light whiegt hai..\n&#39;,
 &#34;Worst product.Screen is very poor.Don&#39;t ever buy\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very low sound and cheap plastic Touchpad\n&#39;,
 &#39;keybord not good also slow processor\n&#39;,
 &#39;Awesome lapy light weight ,decent look\n&#39;,
 &#39;No\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is up to my expectations. Very nice laptop. Price worthy. With all nice specifications.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not able to open the laptoIt is asking for a passwordIs it a new laptop?I bought it for 44000You deliver a laptop that has been used by some one for 1 weekAnd with locked passwordHow can u do in that way\n&#39;,
 &#39;its a disaster\n&#39;,
 &#39;Fraud\n&#39;,
 &#39;An excellent product. But users manual for the pen is not available.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Light and small laptop, easy to carry, original microsoft os , easy to update, use and upgrade. Pen depends on use, works fine, needs cell.  Boot is quick. i did not get any product key to install MS OFFICE. SELLER did not provide activation key.Long term we will have to see.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Usually i dont give stars below than 4 ...but this time its really forced me to give it ine star....... The performance of system is too bad ... Even after 8 gb ram and 7 gen ...its tooo slow ..... Takes forever to load os ...take years to open refresh ... Just stum on screens ...Will not suggest to buy this laptop .\n&#39;,
 &#34;1.From the beginning, the computer kept rebooting and the cursor got stuck,first every 5mins and then every one minute, so frequently that after seeing the logo HP the screen would flicker and computer start rebooting immediately.The cycle would go on for couple of times, then the window says Windows Not Properly Installed. Options given below: Advanced troubleshooting and Shut Down  The computer came with windows installed,but from day1, it&#39;s been saying Windows not properly installed and rebooting and the screen flickering.2. The specifications before buying said With MS Office installed, and when you open and check you find subscription is for only 30days.3. Graphics are poor when it&#39;s supposed to be a full HD computer.4. I have lost all trust on electronic products bought from Amazon. You should have an option for Return not just Exchange or give a free troubleshooting service.Even though I have bought an extended warranty, I don&#39;t have the time to wait and call for service every few days.\n&#34;,
 &#39;The HP 15q 0026tu is an excellent budget laptop with Good quality of Performance and Battery life.Battery avg - 5 to 6hourSound quality- Good quality ( at 70 below)Performance- GoodBoot time -1 minutes and lessBuild quality- BetterCons:No Ms office original version only trail version for 30 days.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Lap seems sooper smooth while initial setup. Doesn&#39;t felt any lag issue like other people claim in their review.. not much satisfied about battery life , thats y 4 giving 4 star. Bt overall it is the best one available in market for this price range.. i opt to purchase this one after 10 days of enquiries and web searches.. it doesnt make me disappointed.. thanks to amazone.. in hp support ,found it is a genuine lappy 😍Review after 2 months -. I just gave one more star and now it is 5 star. Overall pefomance is awesome.. only one problem when creating new folder it lags ore few sec.  Those who felt the system is slow, kindly uninstall useless pre-installed softwares especially mcafee antivirus and install avast free or any other antivirus.. now your problem solved.. u can have a sooper smooth lappy.. enjoy 😍🔥\n&#34;,
 &#39;Very bad experience.  System is booting very slow. Bigger than mentioned. No performance of 8 gb. Requested for replacement.  Amazon denied it. Asked me to go to service centre.  Same day of delivery I am asked to go to service centre to repair.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I like the laptop it has an SSD+HDD option and RAM upgrade option I have upgraded with 256 SSD and 8 GB RAm Now laptop has 16 Gb RAM with 256 GB SSD for OS and 1 TB for Storage. laptop work flawlessly... Awesome purchase.\n&#39;,
 &#39;If you are looking for a no-frills laptop, this is the one. Looks ok, works like a charm, good keypad and overall ticks all boxes. If you compare it to a laptop twice its price, obviously you will be disappointed. This is a WagonR and looks and works like one .  Do not expect to work and look like Honda City or anything higher. Period.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good packing from Amazon... neat and safe... immediately after receiving I thought it was refurbished... but after using for a month... I feel it is a good product... battery and sound quality is satisfactory\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased this item 28th January but due to some argent work I could not use it within return time. This is defected product . Some keys are not working. And very slow process\n&#39;,
 &#39;This is the best laptop in budget range with good battery back up and light weight. I am using Photoshop, image ready and premier without any lag. I bought 8GB varient which helping me boosting performance. I was using Lenovo G560 model with 8GB RAM but it weighs more.  Conclusion: Go for this laptop if your budget is within 35k.\n&#39;,
 &#39;All is well so far.Fast Boot up.Awesome HD Display.Smooth and Great Performance.Nice Keyboard.Good Quality Sound.Cons1. No Touchpad Disable Button. Even in Driver Manager disable option is not present.2. Only one partition and in that Windows is installed.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t know whom to blame the HP guys or the delivery retailer or Amazon people. The product delivered we believe was an refurbished one and not a new product! The laptop started giving issues in the months of service itself. Seems to have some battery issues as even getting charged for the whole day  did not last for a hour.Please don&#39;t buy this product\n&#34;,
 &#34;MS Office is not pre-installed..... And amazom Show&#39;s it was pre-installed!\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good laptop at a reasonable price. But laptop was performing slow when I was using the pre-installed trial version of Mcafee. After I uninstalled Mcafee and installed another antivirus named Comodo, it started working fine.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I purchased this leptop under 34k in freedom sale , which contains 256gb SSD 8gb ram and Intel hd 620 graphics which makes this Laptops l awesome.. only one problem is that, I don&#39;t know how to partitions c drive without formatting.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#34;After using the laptop for 7 days:Packaging and delivery:Pretty ordinary packaging and no manual for laptop.Pro&#39;s:1.Build quality is good and looks premium.2.Easier to carry with light weight.3.Audio and sound quality is good and is audible in an empty room easily.4.8 GB ram version takes pretty much less time to start and loads fast.Cons:1.Display quality is pretty average,colors are not clear.2. No MS office, with windows 10.We need to enter product key after few days which is bad. Should have given MS office.\n&#34;,
 &#34;I just received this laptop today (I&#39;ll update this if there are any issues). And so far, it&#39;s amazing! The sound quality is pretty good, and so is the display. I feel like it could&#39;ve been better if the keyboard was backlit, but that wasn&#39;t a priority. Overall, it&#39;s a well functioning laptop if you&#39;re not a heavy gamer or don&#39;t need a laptop for serious coding. It&#39;s great for everyday use (though it doesn&#39;t have office so that&#39;s a drawback). The keyboard quality and mouse smoothness could&#39;ve been better, but they&#39;re not bad (pretty good). If you need a budget laptop for everyday use, definitely go for this.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Battery life is good good product\n&#39;,
 &#39;Home use, private use, perfect for me, was special offer, all in all best price in town, works like a bomb, all good so far\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very nice laptop. The i3 processor in this laptop and 8GB ram handled all the day-to-day tasks perfectly but gaming is very bad. After installing some apps the os was slow. But for normal use, this is a great laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Let me start from the display. Display quality is good and battery life it&#39;s gives the 3 hours and speed of the prosser is good overall the laptop is good for the students and some office works also.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Worst product ever, don’t purchase it and nt even beginners also can’t use this it’s veryyyyyyy slow and they dnt hv exchange policy also\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good processing speed! Documents load faster. Laptop boot within 8 second. And Shut down within 3-5 second. One Star less for average look.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good laptop... though a bit too large to carry...the topmost keys on the keyboard are small and given the fact that the keyboard has lots of space, they could have easily put larger size keysThe cover of the laptop tends to show the fingerprint marks and smudgesMS office is the student version and doesn&#39;t have all features.Except these negatives, I found the laptop fairly good for routine work purpose\n&#34;,
 &#39;Useless buying it from Amazon... no value for money and trying to get a product activation key from HP support\n&#39;,
 &#34;\xa0I&#39;m giving review after using it one week.Battery life is good almost 5 to 6 hours if you&#39;re making projects or watching movies.Sound quality is very good.I suggest you don&#39;t use Vlc for watching videos.\n&#34;,
 &#34;It doesn&#39;t supports 5GHZ internet. HP should think of including 5GHZ network Adapter.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Excellent for battery backup\n&#39;,
 &#39;Happy with this product..\n&#39;,
 &#39;I giving the review after 20 day of use. I perform well. takes only 2to3 second to start, all applications run smoothly without hanging and battery life is six hours.but one drawback is ms office is only 5 day trial version but overall well at this price\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow for Win 10\n&#39;,
 &#39;Would like to know how to activate the Windows Office.  Not getting activated,  asking to buy\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good performance so far using for software development, ordered on August 2019Recommended for software engineers as 8gb and 256gb ssd is must for ease development\n&#39;,
 &#39;Keypad stopped working after 14 days of purchase. Bad quality of built by HP. Worst seller service experience.\n&#39;,
 &#34;I don&#39;t know whether I am doing something wrong but it is taking too much time to power on\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good laptop, they create only one drive of 1 GB.Windows product key is not shared with me.How to reinstall if OS will corrupt.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very good product with reasonable price. as expected\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best one but little heavy in weight... sometimes get slow other thing no issue...\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not as smooth as i thought it should be, being a 7th gen &amp; 8GB RAM, it functions like my old 4GB RAM quadcore but a downgrade on sounds... the only plus point is i guess it is upgradeable and it cost very less, battery life is also not upto the mark..\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good quality laptop. Only thing missing was microsoft office.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Defective one, neither amazon nor hp replaced the item, even within the period of replacement. Technician sent by both amazon &amp; hp couldn&#39;t detect the problem. But after repeated complain hp technician repaired the laptop.\n&#34;,
 &#39;good look as it have a metallic body and a coating on it but a little bit slow and the system is not up to date.battery is just okay and also it is a little bit heavier.overall good for normal stuffs and entertainment.\n&#39;,
 &#39;If you wish to have proper laptop with good sound effects just go for it blindly.\n&#39;,
 &#39;A very good quality product and excellent battery life\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very very slow and it&#39;s heavy\n&#34;,
 &#39;Not happy at all...save few thousands more and buy a MacBook air. Really disappointed.\n&#39;,
 &#39;the shipping box was in good condition, the inside laptop was safely packed, inside one laptop &amp; charger found.so far performance is good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Over all laptop was good but little bit slow\n&#39;,
 &#39;Premium product. Value for money. However need to update software through HP. Excellent service by Amazon.\n&#39;,
 &#39;I bought this laptop on 14/08/2019.Now a black spot is appeared on the screen within two months.it is difficult to read or use the laptop now.it is a cheap quality laptop.\n&#39;,
 &#34;Very bad product, yesterday I got, today it&#39;s not working, it&#39;s completly blackout\n&#34;,
 &#39;its a stunning laptop. Boots asap, speaks louder, hd videos, stays on for long time.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good to operate and  sleek in design.. must buy...But speed is not as expected and display is also not much as expected.. overall 3.5 stars\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best for students no hanging problem\n&#39;,
 &#39;Ok\n&#39;,
 &#34;Fast, good battery life, good speakers  that&#39;s what I needed. One should go for the 8gb ram version, saves you a lot of Hassel with some extra cost. Worth it I feel.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I just brought this laptop a week befor and it just get blacked out daily\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Not so happy with lappy..Slow in all manner\n&#39;,
 &#39;Camera quality,sound quality nd processor quality low...overall gud\n&#39;,
 &#39;Product is good .But  Ms office is not registered .\n&#39;,
 &#39;\xa0The battery life is pretty good. I can watch upto 2 movies continuously for 6hrs straight of 3hrs each.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Highly recommend for the moderate use. Amazing Battery life. Full HD screen. Awesome Sound. Not for heavy gaming still 8gb ram runs everything smooth\n&#39;,
 &#39;Budget LaptopHp is best to otherGood picture qualityBetter performance to other laptop in functionality and reliability\n&#39;,

 &#39;Hello, guyz.. I m writing this review after using it around 15 days. I was olso confused about the value, but believe me.. I m fully satisfied with my lappy.. Battery life is 4 hours or even more.. Sound is good.. Look... Nd weight is killer... Ossam product in short...\n&#39;,
 &#39;WOrst product by HP. Its warranty period is of 1 year and in this one year, 3 times i had to give it to its customer care.Worst customer care service. Never responded though i have tweeted them also for same.Customer service executive suggests to keep the updated off or the speed of the system will slow further.My past experience with Lenevo and Acer were so good. I regret for trying HP laptop. Wont buy HP products in future for sure.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Whether this model has both SSD 256 and 1tb hard disk with 8gb ram????Please confirm\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is very bad product.  I buy the note book on 25.06.2019 but i was faced mother board porblems. I call to hp support  care but not solve this problems to till date.  The service engineer was delayed for service.So,  I totally lost for money.Dear sir, friends not for buy for this items.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Its nice to use laptop , using it since last 2 months , working file till the time , sound quality is good and display is also good.\n&#39;,
 &#39;At present no problem, easy used to work . Beautiful look. Customer happy .\n&#39;,
 &#39;I purchased it 6 month ago, but i would surely recommend Dell instead of HP.I m software dev by profession and this laptop irritated me by its slow speed nd i had to buy another one due to its slow performance\n&#39;,
 &#39;All are good, it is good laptop for students and practice purpose . I suggest to purchase from amzone only . Because you will get in less rate..\n&#39;,
 &#34;I will like this product very much for gaming it&#39;s screen is also nice easy to charge best product 👌\n&#34;,
 &#34;I am regretting after buying..please don&#39;t waste your money\n&#34;,
 &#34;Don&#39;t buy\n&#34;,
 &#34;I purchased HP laptop from Amazon,it&#39;s worth buying n d product is in excellent condition.am satisfied.thank you Amazon\n&#34;,
 &#39;Worth a penny\n&#39;,
 &#39;I have not received the warranty and guaranty card.it is missing from the box.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Very slow\n&#39;,
 &#34;It&#39;s very slow, I will not suggest it tutti anyone.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good\n&#39;,
 &#39;Best choice\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good product\n&#39;,

 &#39;Good work\n&#39;,
 &#39;satisfied\n&#39;,
 &#39;Value for money\n&#39;,
 &#39;i got ms office only for 1 month......please read the details and configuration carefully.....ok\n&#39;,
 &#39;Recieved faulty display . Keyboard impressions on brand new laptop screen. Unbelievable !\n&#39;,
 &#34;I bought this laptop from a authorized hp product dealers in 53k about a week ago. Laptop has a premium look and it&#39;s blazing fast, thanks to the 256gb ssd. It has a backlight keyboard. I bought this only for programming and watching movies stuff. So far, no complaint.\n&#34;,
 &#39;ProsBoot up time is really fast.ConsThere are heating issues. Laptop hears very fast\n&#39;,
 &#34;I frustrated about this product and delivery service by Amazon. Hated both HP and Amazon. Amazon delivered this product after a week and customer Support guys didn&#39;t know anything about my product, they don&#39;t know proper info about our products which is placed on Amazon. The product delivery time was hectic. I preferred to buy this laptop to protect my data, but it doesn&#39;t have that feature (Windows home edition will not support bit locker and even it will not support device encryption)contacted Microsoft for this issue: they said contact HP and HP customer care is not working even I have LPM 2.0 it&#39;s not workingBattery life is just 3 hoursEventually the laptop is overheatingWindows home edition doesn&#39;t have more features 😫Poor product Quality51k wasted 😔Amazon Please please please please don&#39;t encourage such wrong products and fake sellersAmazon Cons:Product Delivery TimeCustomer SupportDelivery guy contact details are wrongProduct is not genuineServiceHP Cons:Battery lifeOver heatWindows OS Home editionDisk EncryptionPoor Quality of product ☹️LPM 2.0\n&#34;,
 &#34;First time they delivered the laptop the display was defective as it had keyboard imprints in it.otherwise i really like the laptop but i won&#39;t say its the perfect ever.Pros.1)Light weight, compact and has premium look.2) Amazing backlit keyboard.3)good 1080p display4)SSD+HDD+8gb ram which makes it Superfast as well as super useful to store data.5)Decent speaker which is becoming increasingly rare to find.Cons.1) low battery life.2) Does get heated up quickly.i purchased this for academics and coding so i dont regret my purchase at all. but delivering faulty display one first and then replacing to get a new one was a bad experience as i couldn&#39;t complete an assignment on time because i didn&#39;t have a laptop at hand.\n&#34;,
 &#39;It is a bad experience with this laptop twice..I have purchased this laptop second time after the replacement of the first one. Both were facing the same issue of keyboard marks inside the screen..,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Great product from HP. Got this for 1k less price than here from HP website and also got a free laptop bag. Delivery was super quick (Blue dart)Loved the laptop overall. The SSD makes the experience super smooth. However the keyboard looks cheap and shoddy. Buttons on the chiclet keyboard are clicky and might be announcing to few. Display is great so far, just been a week.Will post a complete review after a month. So far, this is the best non-gaming laptop (from my research) under 55k.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Don’t buy, screen started flickering and switching off on the first day only after 1:30 hours of usage, defective laptops, could not check remaining areas as the screen is blank,\n&#39;,
 &#39;Bought it 2 weeks back for my regular use. Its a great performer. Super fast speed and very smooth performance. Beautiful, slim and light. Silver shade is bright. Battery life is good.Got it cheaper @ ₹ 44049/- after exchange of my old Samsung laptop (-₹ 5050) from Fast Deal dealer.Thank you Amazon. Thank you Fast Deal.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Good one..fast processor, good screen, start up/ shut down in 20sec, built is good, full version microsoft 2019.Had some error msg intially but maybe due to some installtn of software.Took time to submit review just to be doubly sure tht its performing fine...\n&#39;,
 &#39;I brought it on 9.9.19.. it is very good to use...Pros:very light weight..keyboard is very good..screen resolution is very good..ssd is very fast.... especially boot up and shut down..cons:screen turning angle is very less... not even 180 degree..personal view : i was searching for full black laptop in this model... but in this model full black is not available....\n&#39;,
 &#39;It is really fast. Screen quality is best with good battery life. This laptop is actually for educational &amp;  business purpose and for light gaming.\n&#39;,
 &#34;If you are looking for laptop for study purpose this is very good for you. Every thing is taken under consideration, it&#39;s look is really adorable, 4-5 hrs battery life very good sound quality. You are getting intel i-5 processor, window 10 home addition.so far i found every thing well and good about this. Yaa if you are looking for gaming laptop I won&#39;t prefer this.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Honestly I was little bit in tension after watching some reviews of this product like keyboard mark mostly. And hoping for not suffering the same...but honestly in my situation I have received the perfect one just when I was opening the packet of the product unfortunately I tore the bill. Please carefully unbox your packet and yeah i am satisfied\n&#39;,
 &#34;Distinguishing product and disgusting service by amazon.Within 2 months got buttons impression on screen.Replacement letter was provided by HP but amazon people are not at all helping out with issueDon&#39;t buy such costly product online\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good product and timely delivery\n&#39;,
 &#39;The laptop is found only for light work. I expected some big battery life. But it gives only 3 hours. Laptop has heating issues also.\n&#39;,
 &#39;battery life - ideal for 4 hours to 6 hours based on your workloadfor gaming - Ok for small Graphics gamesscreen quality - 5 star\n&#39;,
 &#34;Performance is good. And very good laptop if you don&#39;t want for gaming purpose.But I received screen with keyboard marks on it, and I have to replace it.\n&#34;,
 &#39;I am loving it at the moment, shall write after more usage\n&#39;,
 &#34;Good. Didn&#39;t face any issues yet its been a month. Battery easily lasts more then 4 hrs.\n&#34;,
 &#39;Good Quality Laptop for my Son MBA use.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Permanent keypad impression on screen\n&#39;,
 &#39;It good laptop provide descent battery back up .SSD  HDD is increases the speed . Light weight laptop screen resolution also good to see the HD screen.I am overall satisfied with the product.\n&#39;,
 &#39;Just bought before a week back I can’t comment\n&#39;,
