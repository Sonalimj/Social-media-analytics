"According to HP it is a laptop but it falls under family of Notebook. From dimensions it should be classified as Notebook. Light weight, no DVD player and non replaceable Li-on battery. Good 2.3 GHz processor with 4 GB RAM works well. Windows 10 home opening and closing time normal. HP updates all drivers comfortably and window update works well. Box has only notebook and power chord. We have to get all other including warranty through HP website.I have loaded office pro and everything looks smooth. Display is good in some angles. Sound is ok. Very good key board and track pad. Worth buying for the price we pay.

"This product can be used for browsing purpose only, if you open 6-7 tabs at the same time this become worst to operate. Battery is not removable and no dvd port and if something happen then whole motherboard needs to replace.

"I thought HP is very good company with Low range laptop. But it was wrong. I have 4 Low range laptop of Asus and this time I thought lets buy HP in low range. Overall quality is good but performance is very slow compare to Asus Low range series laptop which is under 20,000.I Suggest you to go only with Asus if you have budget under 20,000.I have some high range laptop in my organization with HP brand. In high range performance is good with HP.
"
"Nice performance
"
"my review is for hp 434tx i3 7th gen. after i bought this i should suggest you that never buy any hp laptop. they hang like hell. and their customer care support is the worst. they talk about extension of warranty with 6000 rupee with free headphone, but their support team never visits your home, why should you extend warranty if they didn't come? you will get a call saying we may come? rain ? stupid
"

"
"Very slow
"
"There is no sound in the laptop even after installing necessary drives.Please suggest solution otherwise I will return the item.

"Amazon showing wrong pictures, the keyboard will also have silver colorIf anyone read this review to buy this laptop, it might be useful
"
"I would request customers who have brought items on EMI through SBI card pleasr check your statement details as I had brought this prouduct on EMI of 9666/- including interest but bank is charging additional interest on this. 9666 + 330. Actually if they had to charge then they should have charged either 9666 per month or 9444+interest for three month. I would request Amazon also to look into the matter so that customers can freely use SBI cards for EMI payment.
"
"I'm reviewing this laptop after 4 month of use.Pros:- Overall looks seems interesting.- Screen size and display is awesome.- 3 USB ports, 1 HDMI, 1 RJ45 connector,  USB 3.5 JACK, SD card slot, CD Rom.- With Intel i3 7th gen this laptop works  fine with all applications and  browsing experience is too good.Cons:- You need to wait a minute after starting this laptop to be able to work. Else, it starts to hang.- Full size keyboard. The numeric buttons on the right should not be present.Overall verdict:Decent laptop at this price.
"
"Let me start with my message stating Very unsatisfactory product. It is i3 7th gen with 4gb Ram but it is slower than a celeron processor my other laptop. Infact cant be compared as simple basic task like sending mail cant work in this laptop forget the gaming etc. VERY VERY SLOW . 100% memory and 100 % DISK usage show all the time in if u open task manager.I mailed HP looking at the messages from HP from other reviews. It seemed to be quite promising that someone from HP customer care will take the laptop solve it or replace it sad thing no one even bothered to reply to my mail.So sick HP service.
"
"I have purchase this laptop  and use from last 20 days. Performance wise it is very slow .bulky and not comfortable for everyday use.Suggestions : You will get better laptop in the same price.
"
"I bought this laptop a day ago.It is mentioned in amazon that this laptop has lifetime validity for ms office.But actually it is not.We need renew it every year.Feeling very very disappointed with Amazon for mentioning a wrong feature.
"
"Bloody product doesn't power on at all... When called customer support they reply so adamantly...
"
"display quality and speed both are very bad.
"
"Kindly update about products it's original by HP?Find the photos and confirm the same.I am using currently i5 and i3 but this one looking different
"
"First of all the performance was nothing to write home about.I spent more time downloading and installing updates than actually using the laptop.It was dead slow too. It altogether stoppedworking after 7 months. I contacted HP customer care and they advised software recovery.I tried the steps advised by them still it is not booting.The product is still under warranty and it was used only for online classes and basic browsing IE, no gaming or other heavy stuff.I requested a service visit but they declined saying that for software issues service visit can not be arranged.I don't know what is the use of Guarantee and buying a licensed Windows version .As I am living at a remote place with no nearby service centre,I am left with no option other than dumping the item with this kind of support from HP.Should serve as as eye opener for any one planning to go for an HP laptop.After almost one month the laptop is still not repaired.Should serve as an indicator of the much pom-pom Ed HP service.My advise is please desist from buying this crapUpdate:Now HP says the defect is on hard disk. The service engineer replaced the hard disk. However the USB media I bought from HP shelling out Rs. 1100 is not working. Finally the service engineer installed windows by cloud recovery. (however HP has promised a free replacement of the recovery media). Subsequently the keypad started functioning erratically. The lappy is still at the service centre. I don't know  what to make of the whole process
"
"On first Boot it took around 2.30 hrs  after that never booted always hanged during booting totally waste of money and tension of not returning  this trashPro: Advice goto showroom first try lappy dn buy because for online marketing. They are just selling crap
"
"Please go with another brand,for mine system is crashed within 6 hours of delivery of laptop.
"
"Pros1) sound quality is good2) picture quality is satisfactory3) camera is average, OK in this price range4) keypad is comfortable5) life time validity for windows 10 home and MSO student.Cons1) anti virus macafee is trial version for 30 days2) opening of applications are slow, better to go for i5.3) battery is not easily removable.NoteValue for money laptop. But compromised in performance.
"
"Good product.Awesome battery backupWorth for moneySimple drawback is that it doesn't have antiglare display
"
"Hello Folks,The product review shared by other always help me, buy a product so It is my responsibility to write the review.This laptop I bought 2 weeks ago. Till now my observations are:Pros:Light in weight.Single coat so appearance is nice.Keyboard is robustSound quality is good.Cons:If you want speed this is not a product to buy.Charging speed is not great.Touch pad is not that smooth.Laptop soon become very hot.Overall if you do not want to play games & budget is less than 30 k. You can give this product a thought.Thanks for reading Hope it will be helpful.
"
"Worse purchase I ever had in Amazon. I won't complain anything about Amazon, but here hp is providing low quality product. The laptop's display got damaged within 1 month without any physical damage. When I asked for the warranty they rejected it saying it's not manufacturing defect.it's actually a manufacturing defect due to to low quality parts and hp is blaming customer for such occurance.Don't ever trust in hp products..
"
"would recommend dell laptop over HP after buying this (i have used dell and they are far better than HP)only two major advantages of this laptopms officegreat speakerthe display is low quality, system is slowi have dell also with an older configuration and it performs a lot better
"
"Nice sound quality ,nice backup of 4.5 hrs ,value for money
"
"This laptop is dead slow. I am using an MSI laptop 2013 model which is far better than this. Actual laptop cannot be this much slow, I am sure this is not original. Please don't buy through online. I am into ecommerce side but  I would say never but through online. I replaced the one I received first but replaced one also not bad. I feel I will break this, I have to wait to open a new tab also.. Sad.
"
"Value for money
"
"When system is turned on it takes much time say 20 mins to turn on, provided that I have installed minimal softwares. And restart of system requires more than 1 hr stating that all the updates are running in the background.Sql server will be the only heavy weight software installed, and more than 250gb of hard disk is free. Win 10 preinstalled, i3 7th gen processor. Does anyone face the same issue.
"
"Awesome looking laptop....i don't know why this much negative reviews.
"
"I am really very very disappointed with the performance of this laptop. From the first day till now it never worked normally......lots of hanging issue. For every task it will take minimum of double time and after that also it will be working slowly. Even if I am typing something it will appear after few seconds. I m really tired up of using this laptop and regret of buying this. Look wise it's awesome battery life also average but one and only major problem with this laptop is it get stucked after any command given it includes from starting the laptop to opening your files to typing anything......I don't know why I bought this laptop ...... seriously not expected from Amazon to deliver the product like this....I sometimes feels that it's even original or not ??
"
"Worst product from HP. Performance is too slow. Applications hangs frequently. I got defective one in which speaker head phone was not working. Warranty was also not showing as one year.
"
"Value for money is good but sounds quality is normal and battery life is only three hours. In a nutshell this laptop is good in its price range. Thank you.
"
"First of all the product packing was just great..Second , the laptop is gud.Pros-Anti glare display is just great.Keyboard is gud .Camera is avg.Multitasking is just great.Sound is loud and clear.Laptop is lightweight.Cons-Lags a bit sometimes.Maybe an upgrade of SSD drive will improve performance.For gamers RAM nd Graphics needs to be upgraded.Good for medium gaming.Overall a great laptop in this budget of 31k.
"
"In a single word- it's worth. Initially you may feel that is slow but after updates it will work smoothly.
"
"I received this product on 9th May 2019, as I've not installed any app but it is too slow. Whatever I open it takes too much time to open. Better to go with Dell or Lenovo. Not satified with this kind of product from HP.
"
"I have brought this product almost 1 month back and also submit the complaint on his slow performance. Also I have taken remote support from hp help desk service center but no improvement. Hence they sending there home assistance who is still not turn over and making arrangements as per my availability.Currently seeking hp revert. Or needs to return back such faulty product.
"
"Very slow laptop. Bad purchase now stuck with it. How do I sell this piece of junk?
"
"Super quick delivery as always from Amazon.Have been using this laptop everyday for about 8hrs with not a single issue faced till date.Not sure about its performance for gaming as I have never used it for gaming.Battery life is also pretty good. 4-5hrs with the power saver mode on and mildly heavy usage.Easy to carry around as does not weigh too much and its very compact as well.Overall performance is good with reasonably heavy usage but I have not tested with heavy usage, programming and gaming.My opinion: PRETTY REASONABLE, GOOD PERFORMANCE, LIGHT WEIGHT, VALUE FOR MONEY.
"
"Good laptop with a very beautiful colour and design.. WINDOWS 10 needs upgrade .. after completing of all updation it runs fast..I am very satisfied with this laptop..
"
"Overall laptop is goodA colour that is not common.(standard)Display is superb depend upon the quality you see.Mcafee antivirus for 30 day trial.Performance - goodDisplay- excellentStorage- plenty and enoughGood for programming.
"
"Not as per expectations built quality is very poor not perform as per specification. I think always buy from hp outlet
"
"Review after using 15days...Too slowwwww, worst product by HP, no response by customer care of Amazon.Go with dell or lenovo or any other brand but not with HP or Amazon service.Laptop on krk so jao 😴😴😴😴Can get better laptop in same price.
"
"Good product and meets my requirement
"
"In first place Laptop got delayed while delivering it to me. We called amazon told upfront that we don’t need and when we are trying to return the same without opening the packaging amazon not taking the amazon back. It is just selling the High price products to customers just with images and text and these is no way to return it back if you don’t need or don’t like it or performance is not at your expectations.Poor amazon policy , if you buy this you need to buy with your own risk and it will be final sale and there is no way to return and live with it.When we are trying to down load or upload or trying to install our first software it is Super slow.When we are trying to view YouTube videos and Dragged the video here and there to see the performance and laptop is kind of stuck and responding after 1 or 2 mins. Even when you make video in full screen mode it will take a while to pop up.What not there several performance issues with this laptop Never ever buy this and Don’t Don’t Don’t Don’t Buy this.When we are extracting 500Mb file from zip , Memory reads and memory utilization going up to 100% and you can’t use any application and Dam super SlowUpdated comments on 27-jul-2019 : we have requested for technician visit and tech guy confirmed that there is a issue finally amazon provided replacement and replacement is more worst you can see The pics which I have updated in the review.
"
"Avoid buying this laptop. It looks like someone has put a duplicate processor and RAM inside it. It is painfully slow. I am considering to throw it away and buy a better laptop from Market.
"
"Product activation key missingVery very very very slowI'm totally pissed up...Plz never ever buy this product for God sake
"
"Very bad. System is  very  slow. Getting hanged
"
"After using it for 2 weeks i am writing my review.It is very nice and very useful product. It is for daily use. Battery life is good. It get charged very fast. Screen quality is awsome. I think that camera quality should little bit improve otherwise everything is okey
"
"I love this product. Packing quality is also so good.
"
"Bootup process is very very slow.MS office & Antivirus trial period was over when I bought.There is no drive partition (Only 'C' drive). Battery backup time is 2 - 2.5 hours only.Wifi sucks my jio 4g data very fastly.HP should mention USB 2 port & USB 3 port type.  'C' type USB port is missing.Keyboard letters are very thin & difficult to read and type in low light(HP should provide keyboard back light).HP should relocate the heat vents instead of under display area.When using long time, bottom area of the display screen is overheating.It may affect screen and laptop is too heavy to lift.Otherwise nice laptop.
"
"Just..... Kaam chalauHaving heating issue while charging.So much hanging problem... In just normal daily use
"
"1-Before arrived My Order HP Laptop  i got a message someone will come for Installation but nobody came2- I have read before buy clearly mentioned will be replacement within 10 day's if i don't with performance3-  I really don't like voice quality and picture quality and I called up for replacement another productbut i got to know through cus care it can be replace same one if any default but can't replace with other product which no where mentionedReally Really disappointed as regular customer since many year""s

"Gadget Guys.. Here's a short review of the above model Lappy that I bought today.Design - Very GoodWeight - Surprisingly very light from HPSpecs - Nice config in such a decent budgetFHD Screen - a New addition and quite good resolution especially with Anti-GlareBattery - the most interesting aspect of this Lappy, charged it twice as used heavily to test it. Gives a pretty good backup of 4hrs. Very much satisfiedi3 and 4GB DDR4 combo is performing more than I expected. Initial booting and updates are gonna make feel that the Lappy is slow, but give it time to setup, later Lappy just flies.Overall a pretty good Lappy at an affordable price 😊👍And all this coming in a package of 26.5k in offer after applying Credit Card offers
"
"I just bought, this product from Amazon not too much satisfied from product in range of 31k. Speaker quality is very poor, screen quality is not up to the mark, Not good from my side.But thankful to Bajaj finserv to fulfill our financial need.. 😀 Thnx Bajaj and Amazon
"
"You get what you pay for. The modest pricing is reflective of the responsiveness of the system. However, it does the job as an entry level laptop for basic browsing, reading or as a secondary laptop for use by children.Biggest pros are the screen size and the extended keyboard with a dedicated number pad.Biggest cons would be the slowness of the laptop and the absence of a backlit keyboard (though the latter was known before purchase).
"
"This one is non performing  laptop .Every application is hanging. It does not properly shut down.Microsoft office is quite slow. Sometimes it does not start properly & starts after 10 mins. I have asked Amazon to return it.I wish I should have not purchased this from Amazon.This is my worst experience with Amazon.  They are now not taking back the laptop & they do not return & refund my money.
"
"This is very slow laptop and slower than my 6 year i3 laptop which i had purchased it almost same price.
"
"very worst product . pathetic laptop . hangs every day 8 to 10 times . waste of money . seller not willing to take back within return period . amazon these kind of sellers will surely take down your reputation in market
"
"Please dont buy this junk product. Even I dont want to rate single star, but no other choice, i gave 1 star.Starting from booting to everything was bad... booting nearly 30-40 mins, if you click any app, it will take its own time to come back, sometimes, not coming back at all. I can't believe its i3 and 4 GB ram. very very very worst product ever I seen.even 19th century computer was good compared to this junk product. I'm not sure, how HP delivered this product? they didnt do any quality check? instead of correct spareparts, hp delived this model with scrap items?  I was an HP employee and never had this kind of worst experience with HP product. If HP deliver this kind of product, then HP share value will be zero soon. please wake up...  call back this product immediately.
"
"I am totally disappointed with this product. I thought HP will done the job but it's do slow. Not only that, it often hanging. Is it HP or any local product? How a branded product can be so?
"
"Very bad product no one can purchase waste of money very slow performance like 1 gb mobile phone so hang Battery back up 1 hour if u want to waste your money so purchase otherwise don't purchase any item from this seller customer care said there is no return policy product not returned
"
"It's a decent product in this price range, it could have been lighter though.  With windows 10 preloaded it's definitely value for money. One of the buttons was getting stuck, but amazon after sending a technician and verifying has immediately replaced it with a new laptop.
"
"Please don't buy this, extremely slow.. My 8 years old laptop works better than this..
"
"Purchased this product today along with MS Office .  But while activating ms office it seeks product key. Pls help me.  Where can I get the MS Office key. In package no document regarding ms office.After using 6 months now the mouse is lagging in Windows 10, tried with all obtion but unable to rectify it. Therefor,now using Bluetooth mouse and it's ok. Other than this issue system is superb and working greatly.
"
"Don't hesitate to buy this product if you are a student because it is the best entry level laptop which serve every important functions for every student so please don't hesitate buy itIt also has a pre installed MS officeWindows 10Value for money
"
"As per specifications of laptop, I have to receive lifetime warranty of ms office, but I have got warranty of 1 week and even I have raised a query which is still not replied.
"
"Good laptop for my home use. MS Office was pre-loaded and set up was smooth. A bit slower at starting than my expectation for Core i3 7th Gen, but otherwise good value at this pricepoint.
"
"Very bad experience worst laptop hanging problem from the first day even on personal use I m not using this laptop for playing games and all still this hang on doing very simple task . I thing this is not even have i3 processor becz I3 perform very well . Seller are doing fraud on the laptop i3 sticker but inside tha laptop is just garbage fill.Worst performance worst laptop don't buy this go for Dell laptop these are good then Hp.
"
"Ekdam ghatiya h..act like old laptop.. performance is too slow
"
"Laptop is very slow!! It takes lot of time to start! Battery backup is also bad.. No warranty card provided along with laptop.. poor display.. Msoffice is valid only for 1 month
"
"System come with windows 10 and office suite, but the booting speed is very slow , if you are planning to upgrade system to SSD we can get a better performance wich is 5 * Faster.
"
"Only screen border is black rest of all parts in silver...u cant work in dark area coz there is no light in keybords keys
"
"In this range I guess this is a good laptop. There was a single drive no partition so that one can change. Installing everything in C drive slows down your lappy.Secondly, I had an issue with a black screen error every time I log in into that. But after that it was successfully replaced. Thanks team.You can buy this at this budget
"
"I bought laptop : HP 15-da0327tu 2018 15.6-inch almost 6 months back.  I am totally struck-up with this laptop:1) takes almost 10 minutes to boot up fully.2) Always showing that disk usage is 100% , thought i have only 10% of data in c-drive.3) Google chrome & edge browsers always hangs.Now I am planning to contact HP customer to resolve this , i hope.CORE i3 is not good with windows 10. Always better to go for i5 and above if OS is windows 10.
"
"best quality
"
"For windows 10 to operate smoothly you must have at least 8Gb RAM.The laptop is extremely SLOW and LAGGY.Buying this I ended up in regret.
"
"Extremely slow machine. I only use it for ms word and the laptop is extremely slow.On boot the disk utilization is always 86 to 100%. Processor utilization stays above 47% regardless of me leaving it idle.It is not upto the mark and the performance is not consistent with the specifications advertised.
"
"There is no provision for 0.000000001 star. If it was available I would have given it. The laptop runs very slow. Just like 2G network takes time to open link.
"
"Laptop is good. Reasonable price for the config. Battery seems to drain little faster as compared to the description given. There was some lagging issues after startup but after few changes in setting its running fine. The Keyboard is very soft and easy to use and the num. pad makes it more handy while typing numbers. It could have been better if the keys were of different colour.Overall its good.
"
"Bought this laptop.. since day one this laptop is not working properly have lodged a complaint before given period but after many attempts, I'm unable to contact Amazon customer service.
"
"Battery is good bt sound quality is quite average or u can say below average , processor is also averageTotally disappointed with the product ..
"
"It was too bad experience for me from amazon, like I got used product.Literally packing of laptop was too bad, I can say there was no packing at all.And another surprise was when I unboxed laptop there was already profile created with name “jitu Pawar” that too password protected.You must be seen profile in my above click.Not expected from Amzon.
"
"Best product at this price range.1. Weight is decent2. Gaming performance is not very high.3. I personally like this product because of Battery life. One times of full charge gives me 10 to 12 hours of backup.4. I am using this for last 12 or 13 days, but i have no hanging issues also.Overall if you don't buy the laptop only to play games then i can say this is the best product at this price.
"
"Inspite of having 4GB RAM, it system gets changed. No point of this laptop. It takes minutes to start and to open basic application like Ms excel, ms word and browser like  Chrome, there is a time lag it doesn't function smoothly.. Sad I wasted my 30k for this trash...
"
"Excellent
"
"Sir/madamAs per the requirements...i don't have Ms office. I don't have the bag which was already attached by the factory. So I need a immediate call from you. Otherwise I will return the laptop. Screen quality is not good.
"
"Dear Sir / Madam,I have purchased HP laptop, its touch-pad isn't working well. Need to return back the same. Please co-ordinate asap.
"
"Worst Laptop in the world...Issues:1: Dead Slow2: Frequently hang3: Battery Backup not up to the mark.4: Trouble in downloading anything5: Need Admin access for everything..Overall, Waste of pure hard earned money into the product which is not worth half of it... Go for different..
"
"Battery life not much good, problem is the silver white body colour, easily catch scratches and be dirty easily,,, one should go for black colour body laptop  ,,
"
"The worst Product i have ever bought from Amazon and has hadn't seen such a worst laptop in my life .I had bought this product for my mother three months ago. From the beginning onwards this product had been getting hanged frequently and at this point of time i am unable to atleast switch On this product. More over, it has to be noted that even though the product had on site warranty the HP service team was reluctant to do onsite service. Please read and decide before purchasing this product.HP must re-engineer this and must replace me with another.
"
"The laptop has primitive configuration and will be outdated soon. I wonder why this laptop is still in market by HP.The good things - It starts quickly and the time taken for sleep and wake up is very less.The bad things - It is excruciatingly slow if you have 4 or more tabs opened of a browser - especially with google chrome. There is likely chance of Laptop freezing for more tabsThe worse - The network adapter doesn't support 5 GHZ band and the 4 GB RAM is just inadequate.
"
"Very cheap compared to showrooms outside.Received the brand new lappy with good packaging. Comes with pre-installed Ms Office. I3 7th generation processor. But still there are some lags while performaning normal tasks. Taking a lot of time for booting. Not recommend for gaming.
"
"The worst ever product of hp till now..It broke My trust in hp as I.m using hp products since so many years.. So pls inform hp or their dealers to atleast sought it As this laptop is in warranty period..

"Very bad experience of the product. After using 1-2 months, suddenly one spot had appeared in the screen and gradually it was increasing. Went to service center, they are telling screen damage not fall under warranty. My suggestion is don't buy laptop and other expensive products from Amazon.
"
"Speed of machine is slowest , not good for basic school work also , wonder why hp has bundled such bad product , that might be reason for low price .... will not advise anyone to buy even if price reduced by 50%

"If your budget is around 30 to 32k, this is a very good bye. For general purpose, this is an excellent product. For many this is slightly slow. During first time booting it took a lot of time because of a great no of updates. But after finishing the updates its performance is great.

"Wonderful product for such a price. I got it for an effective price of nearly 17,000 ₹ and I'm delighted to have it.Pros -- Good battery life. Lasts for around 4 hours.- Lightweight.- Doesn't lag.- Price is great.- Trusted brand.- Durable and excellent for daily use.Cons -- Not suitable for high end gaming.- It is DOS, hence you've to install Windows by yourself.
"
"damage laptop received.. very disappointment.
"
"I bought it for my personal use & i'm surprised how it performs. It's super lightweight though battery backup isn't good, might last for 2 hours after a full charge. Switching between tasks is super smooth & no lags even when lots of windows are opened. This is where AMD quad core processor shows its jalwa. I installed windows 10 & it's working awesome. At this price point its supercool product. I got it next day because i'm a prime subscriber. Others might get it late. Go for it, its a jackpot.Note: do check if its covered by hp warranty because in past many people have faced the issue with hp products bought from Amazon. Hp guys say they wont provide warranty for any product bought from Amazon.
"
"its not working properly i need to return the laptop urgently , there are lines on the display of laptop, it did work 10 days only. after that we are facing a lot of problems with it, can you please my product or take return, i am requesting you to take return or get repaired .  how can we get warranty of laptop from HP company ,where we go to get repaired.
"
"Lightweight. HP laptop in less than 20K is worth a deal.The only gripe: I bought in offer period, and noticed that the price changed after offer period to a lower one. Not fair Amazon !The warranty was already found to be updated to the month i bought (Sep) of 2018.Was easy to install softwares.

VGA, USB and HDMI ports are already rusted.Moreover, as per their policies, I will have to coordinate with technician to inspect the product so that complaint can be raised. Product photos aren't sufficient.As per HP website, the warranty was started in June 2018.Will update on basis of response I receive from Amazon.

"This laptop with AMD processor is low budget home use laptop come with DODPreinstalled  os you have to install win 10 64bit os and download the necessary drivers from HP web site.It's moderate laptop for using net surfing other office work. Display is moderate and low end hamming can run in this laptop.
"
"This is a very good budget laptop. I bought this for my dad. Hardware spec are just right for daily basic usage, office apps, movies etc. Screen is good quality. Viewing angle is better than most lappys in this budget.Thing to remember. This doesn't come with OS. Also it lacks bluetooth. But you can go for a ₹200 bluetooth USB adapter and work with it.
"
"Build quality is good. Battery exhaust fast . AMD processor is a bit slow. Once you buy you can't return  cab be replaced on , so check it before buying.  Overall not so Happy
"
"Not even 06 months completed. It's battery became non functional. Laptop doesn't work without electricity ON. Tried to claim under warranty but HP denied for the claim. Worst experience ever.This may be due to design of battery. (Protrusion of battery from the even surface)Laptop's overall functioning is good.
"

"
"It's a good product... now I m using it for almost 4 months now.Nice product and awesome working speed
"
"The screen has developed some lines and have contacted Amazon several time. HP has denied any support on this. I am feeling extremely cheated on this. This is inspite of a senior leadership team calling me back and giving several assurances that it will get sorted in 4-5 days.
"

"You just need to buy/install the Windows 10 and it works perfectly. Not recommended for any person who does not know how to install new OS.- A6-7310 is better than 3rd/3th gen i3 processors- Build quality is good at this price range.- No back-light for keywords, so be aware of the same.- It has Optical drive, VGA Port, HDMI, 3X USB, SD Card reader, Bluetooth, Camera- 3.5 mm headphone jack is awesome, as you can simply plug your mobile headphone and even mic will work.
"
"Good product for 19k.. no issues with the processor or hardware.. I ve been using it since 3 months.. good for students. But the problem is that driver software for usb 2.0 ports unavailable in hp software site.. i had to download lenovo drivers to make it work.. no any other issues..
"
"Wifi connection is not activated even after several times drivers installation. My all efforts are gone in drain and still not it is not working. Online HP help center still.unable to fix this issue. Waiting for the service man to visit personally and fix it.
"
"Based on a week's experienceGood product for the price.Using Ubuntu 16.04Pros:1. Decent amount of RAM: Almost all regular progs runs smoothly. Some heavy files eats up memory though.2. Good graphics: Runs steam based Hitman (2016) game. Though it is expected with A6 APU.3. Decent build4. Good battery backup. Gives around 3 hrs backup when streaming videos with wired internet.5. No problem with cooling till now. Let's see how it holds up in summerCons:1. An hour more of battery backup would have been great2. 14 inch screen is a little small.For now my verdict is that it is a very decent laptop for the price.
"
"worst built quality i have been using this since last 3 months it  is got a crack near the keyboard and also the battery locks are not working properly(one of them is not working et al)
"
"Within two months the mother board got damaged. It was replaced under warranty but the next day cooling fan stopped working. Raised a case and waiting.Edit: Cooling fan was also replaced under warranty. So promoting the rating to two. But now the OS crashes (blue screen) very frequently (twice a day); not sure if it is a hardware or software issue.
"
"Really awesome product,in this price range. I've been using this from last couple of days and I didn't face any lagging issue neither heating issue. I would recommend if your budget range is between 20k
"
"I bought this from Amazon and using since last one month. Till the time no issue found with this machine. Anti glared screen is great and also smoothly works with all applications. I am using Windows 10. Bettary back up is also appreciated it's about 4 to 5 hours for continues  use. Very light weight and slim. As per budget it fulfills all the requirements.
"
"Laptop is delivered within 3 days without prime, thanks seller.Product is very cheap and good performance. Touchpad is not responsive smoothly in windows 7. Overall excellent.For better performance replace HDD into SSD and upgrade RAM to 8gb or 12gb or 16gb.
"
"I buyed this laptop on Axis Bank Credit Card with 24 months EMI. But my first credit card bill with this product EMI includes the complete amount into the statement. Bank says the seller got delayed into converting the amount into EMI and the complete amount is generated in the credit card bill. Whoever has delayed but now I'm in a fuss.
"
"Its a very good product, good value for money. I have been using for 3 months. It doesnt have keyboard light, so using it in dark is a problem. Bt other than than everything is covered. Good for basic uses, even programs also can use. Not good enought for android development cause its amd cpu, arm based system image is very slow.
"
"The product which has been sent to me has a defect that the left side 2 usb device connector is not working at all which is used for the connection of a pendrive, charger or like wise device. As the time of return has been passed  even I can not replace  it now. So what can be described more, it is looking very nice but it just extinguishes the fire of my enthusism.
"
"After researching a ton, I settled on this laptop. Don't let the price fool you. It is solid. I added an extra 4gb of ram to the laptop and now it flies. For those interested...it has 2 RAM/DIMM SLOTS but only 1 is used (4gb) the other is free to add an extra dimm to. also make sure you use DDR3L (low voltage) as im not sure the regular DDR3 voltage would be motherboard compatible...the stock dimm was a Hynix DDR3L 4gb (hynix is hyundai's electronic division). Boot up on win 10 x64 bit is 7 seconds max. The extra ram really makes the computer zip through processes. I've had no heat issues, and no glitches so far after a month of use. I love the weight/solid finish with a pseudo brushed metal type of artwork around the touchpad areas. It doesn't feel like cheap plastic. The AMD A6 is one of the best processors and has a great long life if you take care of them well. I have an older A6 dual core that is still running well after almost 6 years. Of course you have to clean your laptops vents from dust and keep it in a cool place and your AMD A6 will serve you well!. Don't waste your money on an overpriced INTEL I3 i5 etc generation processor...its a complete waste of money. Plus intel has had lawsuits in the past over faulty soldering of processors (just google it).... The only things I didn't like were that the keyboard is fused into the laptops' moulding which makes cleaning the keyboard harder (thankfully i bought a keyboard protector but still this should be designed better as a removable keyboard), the screen is ok and it is great that it is anti-glare (matte finish) by default but dont expect an IPS HD screen at this price point. This is more for presentations/students/moderate office work stuff...I haven't tried gaming on it but I wouldn't expect a high FPS on this laptop.Finding drivers for this pc is a bit of a pain...but it can be done....first install the HP Support assistant and follow along as it checks your pc drivers and warranty etc...or you can look for a similar HP laptop with a similar chipset....and use the drivers from its support page....like the HP 15g 221au drivers some of them work for this pc .....Oh forgot to mention as an audiophile you will love this laptop's sound quality (speakers are located on the bottom where you're wrists usually rest....but the DTS sound application along with the REALTEK sound driver (they make the best sound cards imo as a long time user).....will blow you away...don't expect solid thumping bass as its unrealistic to do that...but the sound clarity and volume loudness is very good compared to other laptops....put in a good set of over the ear headphones and play with the DTS settings....(which turn off the default generic windows equalizer) and you will be amazed at the sound clarity and bass produced via the DTS application.the webcam is really good and great to do basic skype or photo snaps with....This computers bios if I remember correctly also allows VT (virtualization technology) so those interested in virtual machines or other simulation software would be able to do it with this...The DVD drive is a slim dvd writer....with a small profile and quiet when spinning/readingIt has a Rj 45(lan port), vga port, hdmi port 1x usb 3.0 port, and 2x usb 2.0 ports Touchpad is responsive but not made by synaptics (Elan touchpad) which is a bit of a downer as synaptics makes the best touchpads....but this gets the job done still.....no issues with trackspeed or movement...Bluetooth is very good uses the realtek chipset and connects on the first shot...no issues there...realtek wifi chip is very good as well...can get signal from 3 floors down (in a concrete house with rebar and several walls btw) you just need to make sure you get a good wifi driver for the card to work really well as the default windows driver only gives like 1 bar whereas the realtek driver gives you 4-5 bars of signal strength.....plus settings you can manipulate via device manager/control panel....I recommend getting this laptop if you are on budget and also buying a keyboard protector (saco brand makes it)....sure this laptop is about 2 years old in terms of chipset (probably mid 2015 to 2016 in terms of the AMD A6 7333 but at the price point along with what comes with it in terms of ports and chipsets its well worth it! Go buy it!If this review was helpful please click the LIKE / HELPFUL button! Thanks! :)

"Great laptop for the prize. Will give it a five stars if it was delivered with Windows 10 installed
"
"Took 3 days for delivery. Laptop is not the best and there is a noticeable lag here and there. But, in this price range, it is the best you can get. Battery life is superb and you can use it for most softwares.... Don't buy it if you use heavy coding softwares. Otherwise for normal company use, it is good.

"So its been 3 days with this laptop an i have no complaints so far yet there are some stuffs that could have been better and done well. let compare each aspect of this laptop one by oneBUILDi bought this laptop to carry it when am in a vacation or outdoor most and in this part i have to say its a firm one and light weight but what i noticed is the whole this feels so plastic. there is enough place to rest you hand while typing but i really felt the need of keypad back light when i was doing my work in dark. the top has some really good texture with hp logo. though there are three USB port but none is 3.0. there are led lights for both webcam, on the right side of the the laptop coupled with HDD led notification and surprisingly LAN port light.on the right side there is our usual CD reader and writer. keypads are tactile and clicky. on the front side there is card reader and on the left there is 3.5mmjack and HDMI and at the back u can swipe back the battery from the down sidePERFORMANCEi bought this laptop for my daily coding and making presentation and stuffs. with AMD A6 and G4 Radeon i didn't so any lags our massive slow downs. though i strongly recommend that heavy software like ADOBE and games like GTA 5 should be left out.yet it is to be considered that since its AMD some compatibility issues with emulators is expected(updated) i have not yet installed any antivirus so far since defender seems to be pretty good. yet after installing adobe photoshop it started lagging. games like company of heroes tend to lag a littleSTANDBYbattery tend to lag 3 to 4 hours depending on the usage though i have an average opinion about the battery.it can be detached by sliding two locks at the back bottom of the laptop and pulling the pipe battery out.SCREENscreen seems to be bright enough with anti glare which seems to be good outside though sunlight shooting straight may create difficultyCAMERAit is equipped with  a one mega pixel camera with a microphone which is quite a decent one. it is good when photo is taken in enough lighting but when it comes to low light it is prone to distortion. it is sufficient for video chatsSPEAKERspeaker are bedded at the bottom front of the laptop which i would rate 6 out of 10. they are audible finely when there are no noise but when you are outside with disturbance they are not audible at allVERDICTthis laptop is good for its compactness.if you are an average user and need to do productive works like working on excel sheets or make presentation this is a fine choice. the only say i have is about the plastiky finish and performance which when considered with money seems OK
"
"the screen is awesome, anti glare, the battery life decent and the keyboard is good. Slight heating on the bottom but not much although summers yet to arrive. Sound is very good, overall at this price point, excellent
"
"Cheaply Build. The Plastic is brittle. Lags like your grandmother. It takes forever to open windows.
"
"I bought this exchanging my Acer Aspire V5 intel i3 laptop since Pentium Gold processor is almost same, except for lesser L3 cache memory (3 MB to 2 MB).There is absolutely no heating or any other issues due to SSD. This fits my requirement of day to day browsing, reading, videos etc.  Very good laptop for this price.Good price for old laptop & card discount from ICICI due to Diwali sale.

"The Laptop has a decent display, boots fast and does what it should for the price. However, the Microsoft Office mentioned in the listing is a 30-day trial version. However, the vendor conveniently mentions that Microsoft Office is available without providing any hints that it is a trial version.When I called up Amazon Customer Support. I was told -1. The Product only has a 30-day trial and that this has been clarified in an User Answer. There are 4 products and 3 user answers. Completely not appropriate2. I was asked to purchase the license for 8k.This is a complete cause of Deceptive Advertisements by the vendor.

"I have received it today only.. Done basic set up. Original windows 10 & Ms office 2019(Life Time).System is pretty fast in terms of booting.Those who are complaining about Ms office 2019 for 30 days, first understand how to activate Ms office 2019....1. First create your own outlook I'd like how we are creating in Gmail, Yahoo....2. Then Left side bottom search box, just type  Excel and click the Excel.3. It will ask you to activate.. just click activate and enter your outlook username and password, what you have created or already having.4. Enjoy for life time..5. Meanwhile don't click office 365, bcz its not for life time...I hope you will enjoyReview after 15 daySystem is superb. It's very fast in terms of opening Ms office,GC,IE... No lagging...Those who complaining about hanging... Update the system even bios also...Once it's done you won't find the lag...Meanwhile don't expect the speed when you're booting first time...31/10/19 updateWhen I clicked ❓in the right bottom, opened HP page. Where I got the 4 updates. It seems, it's very important update for bios, Bluetooth, lan and wifi. Those who are complaining system is slow, this update may helpful...
"
"Dont buy this, in 3 months  of time, hard disk conked off.Laptop is pretty slow .Have to incur an expense of 5k to get a new hard disk.Amazon should have a larger period of return window for sensitive products like laptop.Actually  a loss to buy this laptop from the seller.Better to go with offline stores like Croma or exclusive dealer of the brand.

"
"This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price. Overall just a fine product for browsing but not more.
"
"From the reviews, I purchased this laptop only to regret it later. I contacted amazon for return but they told me a 10-12 step solution to make laptop faster which I implemented. The laptop did become a tad bit faster but returned to being the speed of the first generation computers in the world.Now I am frustrated using it and would highly recommend to not buy this laptop.I don't know if Amazon can help here. My INR 30000 wasted in this utter disappointment of a product.
"
"superb laptop with win10, ms office, all preloaded and 8gb RAM/ 256 GB SSD. Very quick to boot and no lag. Dropbox giving 27GB space free with this and One drive gives 5 gb space So all one needs is an extended warranty ( bought for 1500 on Amazson) and a optional Pendrive ( bought a 64 GB) for storing documents etc. Bought in exchange so paid Rs.23,236 ( Rs.4760 for old Sony Viao plus some SBI card discount), so really happy with my purchase. Good screen and battery backup. Only miss not having a backlit keyboard, rest all is great!
"
"The HP laptop, 14 inch, light weight and genuine softwares is a perfect combination for anybody who is in search for a decent laptop.After couple of days of working, here is what I found,Pros:1. Windows 10 & MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I've reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.
"
"In the first 20 days mouse was not working had to open the laptop and got fixed easily but what's the point? Also I beleive the HP quality is gone down. This laptop screen  does not open much its just till 90 degree. Also the original pro e shown is high and then it make you feel as if they are giving you high discount but it's the actual price.. Not happy with the quality
"
"Do not buy hp products... Service is just waste.. To replace a faulty part already 20 days over without any further updates.. This is my experience and if you buy it.. You can experience it also..
"
"I have taken this laptop 3 months back, and it was quite horrible in the beginning.The speed was so slow that even I needed to wait around 30-40 secs to open a small size excel file. I even tried contacting hp but did not get much help as it was screen sharing session.I consulted one of my friend to it, he helped me out in increasing laptop's speed, he actually removed all unwanted/unnecessary software which were pre installed. Like, McAfee (Not needed when you already have built in Windows defender), some unwanted game software and then he did fragmentation in order to utilize space holes in memory.It really worked and I am able to use the software which I need in a quick of time.You can try this to increase the system performance. Hope this will help you out!
"
"This is one of the best laptop in this price range, also there is some confusion related to MS office trail version, i purchased this laptop 2 days back and i conform it has MS office 2019 student version for life time free.Just go for this!!!!!!!!!
"
"I hate the thing that in the ad they say Microsoft Office is free where as it is a silly one month trial for that its not worth it far more better options available please either provide the lifetime MSO or else my order is up for return
"
"I am a software professional and I like this product for its light weight and faster booting time. However I can not like its camera quality. it is very poor. After 4 days when I booted it started its own updating of BIOS straight from HP and for reasons I could not understand . At the same time its OS windows updated itself which is not a surprise. Some of its claimed features like integrating with my mobile on an instant basis is NOT happening even after several attempts by me , which is not surprising considering Windows commercial nature and its cunning features. I do not know  for what reasons but sometimes it suddenly loses its contact to internet by wi-fi which feature  I am  using on regular basis as a default one. I bought it because its has MS OFFICE which updates itself because it has come loaded with it. Otherwise Microsoft breaks your computer if you had loaded it from your friends CD. I tis very fast ,very light and jet black colour is very attractive. Arrived one day before in good condition but they should have supplied a bag for free.
"
"Pros:-Really nice laptop-Quite fast. Boots in less than 10 seconds.-Screen quality is decent.-Battery last more than 6-7 hours on medium brightness. Average usage-Sound is satisfactory.-Value for moneyCons:-Cheap plastic body. I am scared to carry anywhere.-In less than 1 month, print on keys is faded. Poor quality print.-Webcam quality is pathetic. It's like a vga camera-Adapter is heavy. Almost weighs 70% weight of laptop. Beats the purpose of portability.
"
"Thin and light weight , this laptop is quite good . Performance is also good. Windows 10 work smooth. The set up is automatic and very easy. The display is not that great but for the price point quite acceptable. Overall a good buy.
"
"Display very poor qualityBuild quality poor just poor plasticKeyboard not so softPerformance averageAs a brand HP it's look like so poorIf you are paying 27k or 29k for this laptop you should go some higher range laptop with good full hd display if IPS is the best.If looking for normal work go with lower range with less RAM but you will better display keyboard and build quality.But don't buy this display is jerk.
"
"Pro: In exchange i got this lappy with i3 7th gen, 256gb ssd, 8gb ram and original win10 & ms offic, weight 1.4kg @ ₹24200/-. In this price i consider it worthy of purchase. Looks of the laptop is also good.Cons: Poor web cam, Screen quality is not good, its avg, not backlight keyboard & speaker doesnt produce bass much.Overall all looking at price and the hardware specs i m very happy. Photoshop & video editor works fine. Good for student & office going people. I switched from asus x200ma to hp 14q.As per configuration of this hp 14q its really fast. Boots up in 2-3sec.
"
"its been almost 4 hours I am using this Laptop and trust me I am loving every bit of it, its handy, looks cool, sleek, its beautiful, its light yet super fast. battery charges quick tons of good things, 256GB SSD and 8 GB of RAM are the main highlights the only thing that could have been better is the screen but then its under 30000 so not a big deal HD+ display is still good enough.thumbs up and thank you HP, thank you Amazon.
"
"Didn't worked like new laptop even 1 day . From the date of purchase it didn't worked well as it has very very slow performance and i contacted hp support many times but they did nothing and i myself tried to reset it and failed then gone to hp care and thry said that window is corrupted u have to pay rs. 400 for cloud recovery, i have to pay for service even in warranty,wtf is this?? Worst experience with hp. If you face u any problem on 1st or second day then pls return it. Other wise u will get irritated from hp service.😑
"
"I bought this laptop especially for the reason that it had MS Office included. Apparently, the procedure to activate MS office is to call HP customer care and they will take the remote connection and activate it.Its been 2 weeks since laptop is delivered and I have made some 10+ calls to HP customer care each of which is of 30 min+ duration and still, the MS office is not activated yet.Terrible experience after buying a brand new laptop from HP.
"
"For the price this is the best SSD laptop one can find buying a laptop with an HDD is just naive when u can get tons of storage using an external drive. The screen is also decent and much better than I expected but would have preferred a full HD display. Battery life is poor as one gaming session drains the battery low. The laptop is quite light and comfortable to use. The camera is poor to say the least.
"
"Been using it since 1week and its working fine. Display is good, sound quality is superb, takes a few seconds to boot and it functions very quick and smoothly because it has ssd which is the biggest plus point. I didn't find the battery life very long lasting but it gets charged soon. It met my requirements both in work and entertainment purpose. Overall its a go for it product at this price range.
"
"Excellent value for money. Super fast boot thanks to ssd. i3 processor 8 gb ram 256 gb ssd.. Win 10 os.. Ms office 2019 home and student included.. Great deal!!
"
"Unbelievable laptop, for this price point there is no match available. Sleek, light weight, super fast. No point spending large sum of money on other brand. This by far one of the best product for this price.
"
"CONS -Its just a day old laptop but start showing its signature of slow processing..It takes more time than usual to start and shut the PC and also sometime it slows down in responding to the Feed Input.Display Quality - I m bit worried about the display quality as gentle press at the back of display can be seen on Display with merge of color at the spot (when pressed).Pros -Battery life is Quiet Good (upto 5-6 hours) N can be Fully charged in 1.5 hoursSpeaker Quality is GoodLight in Weight n Compact in SizeI will rate it 3.5 Star based on 2 days of Usage.
"
"Build quality is great and super thin laptop. I got this in 1 day andPros:SSD M.2 NVMe PCIe type8 GB Ram DDR4Core i3 7th Gen with 3MB Cache3 cell batterySuper thin body and lightweightCons:No fingerprint ( Not mandatory required to everyone)No Type C port ( Very few people use as type c to type c cable are not common)Lookwise it is simple.Recommend!

"The product ie i3 laptop two numbers i got from you is not working properly.  Speed also very poor.  Only security window opens then only curser visible.  Window screen not opens .  I wish to return the products
"
"See....this laptop is not for watching movies, gaming etc...you can use it for day to day work and it will work really fast and good... specially when it's super fast while window is starting and shutting down...8 Gb RAM and 256SSD is doing the stuff...DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE DOING THE HEAVY USAGE... KEEP IT SIMPLE
"
"This is the new model by HP and got the deal in Great Indian Festival at 29,990. No issues in Warranty, Windows 10, Office. All are original. Laptop boots in 5-7sec due to its SSD feature.If you are planning to buy a laptop for delicate purposes like office work, watching movies, youtube, listening music, this is the perfect choice. Don't go with normal HDD laptops, it will be slower afterwards because of its mechanical functionality.I will modify my review after 7 days of usage.
"
"Please don't buy this Model. It's just waste of your money. I bought this with so much expectation but all gone. Only 2 things are good in this one is light weight and other is battery life rest nothing to tell.
"
"Well the laptop is quite good. Battery life is average... It lasts about 4-5 hours. It is amazingly light. Laptop looks very premium. Processing is also good. But it is ideal for casual use. No problem is faced during web browsing, watching movies, editing documents, etc. Overall it is a good one. And of course it is ""value for money"".
"
"After seeing lots of positive and negative reviews I decided to purchase this one. Its working fine. Battery back up good, screen display good, easy to carry because of small size and lightweight. Faster because of having SSD. Overall satisfied.
"
"Operating sysytem is little bit slow..... Reboot tine takes time.Body quality is soft and not firm like dell.One has to handle with care. Battery life is good and sound also good.But price wise the product is ok....
"
"Not a good product at all. Very slow. Ram cannot be upgraded over the 4gb slot. Lots of issues in slowness and had to call HP technician to take a look at it.
"
"This is nice laptop.All functions available like MS office with lifetime validity..Sound quality is very superb .I think HP should be preferred over Dell laptop.simple 4 start for performance.Highly recommended for Home use and normal routine work this is best laptop.
"
"I have purchased the best product available globally, but am not able to use it. Obviously, there is nothing wrong with the product, however, however, it is lying unused. I am sure team HP will feel eqully bad if not worse for the product lying unused in a remote corner of the Globe. But, like it or not, this is a STARK FACT STARING us in the face.
"
"Microsoft office (Excel,word, PowerPoint)is lifetime valid. Don't open office at first- create a Microsoft outlook id and the. Login with that, otherwise u get only trial version.Screen is average,speed excellent boots in seconds. Light weight easy to carry is the highlight.
"
"Very good product. Thin and lightweight.  Battery backup is very good. I am writing this review after using the product for more than two weeks.
"
"Got an awesome deal on Amazon Great Indian Sale. The laptop is compact with awesome performance at this price point. The inclusion of an SSD is an added attraction since the boot time is just 10 secs.
"
"Go for it ...Ms office lifetime available without any chargesWindows 10 orginal ( i.e full security)Portable and light weight with average screen quality😉
"
"This is a very light weight and travel friendly laptop. It process fast and has good memory space. It can be used by professionals working on basic applications such as MS office. This system also turns to be college friendly. It has a smooth keyboard and the video quality also seems to be good.
"
"Very slow and keeps hanging. Only for regular student work and doesn’t involve huge applications. The HP service is very bad. Though displays on-site warranty they insist to run around to service center. Don’t recommend to buy this product at all.
"
"Laptop is very fast with 8 GB RAM and SSD. Response is fast even when using multiple software's. Battery gets 100% in 45 minutes and gives backup for 6-7 hours. Screen quality is good. Good laptop for office and research work in sub 30k price.

"I ordered this laptop on May 11 (Saturday) and the product reached to me early morning on May 13 (Monday), so kudos to Amazon's delivery! I was worried about any damages or scratches, but the laptop was well packed.Coming to the laptop, I'm writing this review after using it extensively for 2 weeks. My review is divided into the pros and cons to cover all the features of this laptop:Pros:1) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.2) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.3) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.4) The touch is brilliant and extremely responsive. The inking pen has a quick response as well. If you're a designer, the inking pen can act as an added benefit, however, for me, it does not have any other utility than to play around with Paint 3D.5) Multifunctioning is smooth and the laptop doesn't lag or slow down when switching from one application to another.6) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.7) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.8) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.9) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.10) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn't feel any change in my typing speed.Cons:1) The screen- The screen is only HD and not FHD, so if you like watching 1080p videos, you won't get that full HD experience.2) There is no IPS or In-Plane Switching feature. The screen quality shifts with the slightest change, so you need to keep the screen in one angle to enjoy your video content. Even the slightest shift to the angel can lead to a change in contrast and black levels. So, not a comfortable experience overall.3) The volume is fine. It's not loud enough to play audios and videos for a large room full of people. You'll need a good speaker for your entertainment.4) The laptop heats up a lot when plugged into charging to a really uncomfortable level. You can't use the laptop on your lap while it's charging, especially in summers. I had to put the laptop in front of an Air Conditioner to cool it down a little.5) Though the laptop is sturdy, I'd suggest you avoid using the 2-1 feature multiple times at once. (just saying)Overall, there are more pros than cons of this laptop. The biggest minus point for me is the screen. I focused on the 256 GB SSD and didn't pay heed to the screen resolution and IPS. But, It's a good buy and I'm using it for both entertainment and work without any major concerns.This is a really good laptop if you wish to buy a 2-in-1 laptop and have a budget of 40-45k, but you can buy an FHD display with the 14-dh0101TU model that has the same specs as this one. I don't understand why the 101TU model wasn't launched with this and launched only a few days after it!
"
"I bought it for my sister, she is a freelancer and I must appreciate the look first. I have used it for few hours and find so much comfortable in using, writing and overall accessibility of it. The built, texture and look of the laptop is quite premium. The touch screen is quick. It turns into a tablet very much quick and keyboards get disabled, so you don;t have to worry about keyboards getting pressed mistakenly while using it as a tablet.It is FHD, the visuals are good. The speed so far I have pretty much enjoyed.I recommend this laptop for students, freelancers, artists, writers and also good for traveling.It could be bit more lightweight but then, the cost must be high, so I give it that.the pen works cool. I am going to try more of it over the months, then see how it goes further.Overall, It is a must buy considering the price, brand, specifications, value for money and overall what you are getting here. If you want more specifications, you can go for i5 version or 8GB RAM version, but this model overall is cool
"
"This is a preliminary review as I have just received the laptop and played on it for a day. It looks beautiful and slim. 2 in 1 looks very good, as a tablet with inking technology, it is amazing. Pen is good, it will be better to add a screen guard as we need to force the touch of the pen to the screen. This is my first i3 as I have always used i5 or i7, speed seems to be fine but have to see after loading bunch of software. SSD hard disk will be definitely a boost, planning to throw another 4gb ram stick to make it 8gb to compensate i3 performance. So far so good, will update later.First edit:It does not have backlit keyboard and modifying hardware like adding RAM or adding bigger SSD is very difficult in this model, just found all X360 hp laptops are compact and tightly packed like mobile phones. Battery is placed inside and could not be replaced easily like other or older hp laptops. This is definitely an inconvenience for people who are computer savvy and keep updating their laptops.
"
"I think, It's a great deal and works like a charm. I was skeptical before buying this but overall it is a good buy if your budget is between 40k-50k as it comes with corei3 8th Gen,MS Office, Windows 10,360 degree, Tablet and touch screen with pen.. so what else we need..I did not feel any slowness as well so far.. However this review is based on 3 days of use.. so wait and see if someone is writing after a month.. but we can buy it👍
"
"first thing first -performance of this machine is same as an i3 with ssd has to be -no complaints there. Its a Very good looking laptop. you will surely love it.But Biggest letdown is display. Let me tell you that if you are considering a laptop then look for full HD display.this one has HD display which provides so so images. The let down by display is visible all over.more to that the Glass on display is pathetic-as it reflects everything . It makes viewing so difficult that it keeps you annoyed all the time.i will update more as i get  more of it.UPDATE:- i am using it now for a considerable time.My biggest complaint was display and let me admit honestly that i am now used to it. i do not find it that annoying. But yes, i would still suggest to go for FHD laptop with few bucks more.Actually HP should have given FHD at this price point.(i bought this at 43K).Touch screen is gd. i am not using the Stylus at all,i think this will be case with every other customers. (samsung Galaxy Note owners know it well).the stylus -its there , because its just there,actual use is minimal.). So while purchasing don't get distracted with HP pen. its not an advantage unless you really require it.
"
"I m very much satisfied with laptop...fine touch screen....stylus pen working excellent........keyboard very sleek......video quality up to the mark...works very well for writing taking notes.....browsing is very fast....got it for 40700 on prime day
"
"I got the laptop for 42990 which is a fair deal and as usual Amazon is awesome. First let me give you the cons.Cons:1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) the viewing angles could have been better.Now the pros:1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is inlclude.Overall worth it.
"
"Initially I had an issue with activation of Office. Very pleased with feedback provided on my review. Was able to activate MS Office. It does come with MS installed and usable. Hence changed the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.The unit is very lightweight. I was looking for a reasonably priced 2 in 1. Overall a very good value for money. The 4 GB of RAM seems a bit insufficient. Else, it serves my purpose of using the system mainly for documentation, spreadsheets and presentations. Yet to try out the pen..EARLIER INITIAL REVIEW.... Changed as above!!!By reading product details we get the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. The product details etc. are to be changed to clearly indicate this.Note: We just got the delivery last evening. The review will be changed if in case we find the activation key or if the seller provides the same.
"
"Works like a charm on the very first day, hopefully it stays so, amazing looking lappy at an affordable price, go for it and pray for the guys we’re in good mood while packing it, just like for mine
"
"With the best options for a student, with silent and fast flash-drive based operation, this is a great buy. We paired it with an external 21"" HP monitor and USB Keyboard/Mouse set to make it an excellent desktop at home and portable laptop away from home.. Legal Windows-10 and MS-office-home-student version makes it even more of a value proposition..
"
"I purchased this laptop on 30 May and it was mentioned that its available with microsoft home in it but now outlook is showing unlicenced. What does it mean as i am unable to work with outlook? Everytime i open oultook it asks me to confirm my mail id and start with all the process of signing in.
"
"I purchased with good deal in exchange of old laptop.It is very nice built quality compared to my old laptop. Metal finish, looks premium. Light weight & sleek.Boot time start and shut down time less than 5 sec, very fast because of SSD.Display, Mukti gesture trackpad, touchscreen  and pen use extremely useful. Speakers are good.Battery backup for video streaming is 7-8 hours and for mild to medium use gives at least 5 hours, Can use for a day with single charge.Genuine HP product, checked on website 1 year warranty.MS office included, needs activation only.SSD storage available is 212 gbOut of 4 gb ram, 2 gb already occupied but most of work done smoothly with slightly lagging.Cons - display is HD not FHD OR IPSNo Backlit keyboardNo fingerprints sensorOther 2 models available with overcoming this feature which cost 10k extra.Major plus point - SSD + ms office + 360 convertible + pen includedthis is best model in market if u get it around 30k, just go for it.
"
"Its fine, @ 42k its disappoiting why company omit backlid led keyboard.Licensed ms office ( outlook not bundled )Pen funtionality is not so great.Also mouse pad has a creaking noise. I made 2 attempt for replacement but no one processed my request.
"
"It's my first touchscreen laptop. But I've handled apple products before. So the touchscreen (obviously) doesn't add up. But I am pretty satisfied with it's look and functionality. Battery doesn't last long though.
"
"Very Good Model for medium level users. Delivered the product one day  before actual predicted date.Booting speed is really good.  Only thing is that once you received the product,  you have to remove many apps which are really not required. Touch is of average quality.Got a very attractive price for the old model.
"
"On 16th jul 19 received my hp pavilion able to switch on followed instructions next day when i switched on after providing pin blank screen is appearing.Lets c will i get some help. After which vl update
"
"I brought this in primeday offer, after replacing my old laptop I got it in very low price which was never expected. Worth for price... But they mentioned as it has fingerprint scanner I'm not able to find anywhere in the laptop. HP should increase RAM capacity and HDD capacity which will be more helpful.
"
" The 360 feature is great and the laptop is so fast in performance. It appeals to the looks so much and you get the value you spend. The key board is super quick and smooth in function, little heavier though. HP always surprises with innovation and this product also amazed me though little lesser than my previous one I bought, spectre 😜
"
"At best an average product. Turned up with dead pixels on screen when switched on out of box. HP support says to contact Amazon. Amazon agent sets up replacement but no-one turns up to collect it back. Better to buy directly from manufacturers website instead of Amazon or third party retailers as in case of any out of box issues you will be shuttling between the two without a resolution. Description says HD screen but colour is so dull looks like non HD. Windows HDR configuration setting doesn't detect HD screen. Buy it only if you want to shuttle between Amazon and HP and still have dissatisfaction.
"
"Amazing Laptop. It is fast, touch is good, pen is working.It is completely worth buying. I think this is the best laptop at this price.Note: There is only one issue which is the battery doesn't work for more near to what hp claims. It is still very descent.
"
"I would have bought it for 42490 but I bought it for 44490 saying it was lightning deal just rubbish.
"
"Look wise and spec wise its a very good laptop. You may have to purchase external hard disc separately since this variant  comes with 256 GB but this is SATA.
"
"I am using the product hardly for 5 days, I found rest thing is good but battery backup is really bad. It's just the start and after full charging the battery goes hardly 3-3.5 hours. I am worried going down the line how long it will work. The product claims to have a battery life of 5 hours, but it's not true.Not happy with battery :-
"
"Got the product  with exchange if i3 laptop. Working fantastic.Mcafee purchased  after one month expiry.Rest windows 10 with ms office free. Fast response . Only constraint is 256 GB ssd. Thank u Amazon.
"
"Touch screen and flexibility is the highlight which is available in other brands as well.Screen quality is not really good game put picture to understand better. Not visible from all angles.
"
"By reading product details I got the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. Please check and confirm whether the office comes activated or not? Also, I tried following the instructions given in one of the reviews, but that would not help too. Kindly help regarding this issue asap!
"
"Quite good product, received in a good condition. But don't know how to turn on the backlit of keyboard.
"
"Any bad review to this laptop does not suit this awesome laptop most people think that touchscreen is a disadvantage but this laptop is finominal also great for gaming in mine craft when PC will be in PC mode though when you turn it into a tab it turns into pocket edition best laptop of all time.

"Let me tell you a cautionary tale. I bought this laptop in late feb 2019. It has gone to the service centre thrice. It crashed in the third month. Motherboard crashed again in June. The system works now, but I have wait 15 min for it to start. The chrome doesn't work. MS word crashes every other hour. If you decide to call HP, their people will repeat the catchphrases like, "" we are sorry"" ""let me connect you to somebody"". That somebody will tell you that your system needs this or that- "" get your RAM upgraded"". Then you will do that and system will crash again. You will call them again, and again and again, till you decide that it was your fault that you trusted HP.Moral of this Story:1. Never buy a HP Laptop2. Never believe a customer care person ( He /she has no clue !)3. Never trust HP service.4. Don't fall for the touch and x360 gimmick. Its given so as to hide the fact that this machine doesn't work !5. Finally, choose anything but HP.
"
" I bought Hp Lapotp in June 2019 on amazon. Started having problems from start, complained to HP for attending defects ONSITE. they never came. Forced me to run to their service cenetr 25 km away. Then HP aksed me Rs 21,000 for Laptop under warranty ! HP website shows my laptop as 'expired warranty'. Never Buy HP Laptops/PCs. HP doesnt honour warranty, makes customer run to their service center. HP has Customer relation Manager concept. If u got any problem and u r not satidfied with HP rpoduct, repairs etc, this man is the ONLY point of contact and he shall ensure that u cough out money for repairs as everything they put blame on customer.Inferior quality material is used for Base Panel and Hinges. Have been having DELL laptop for self and my company, DELL is just Excellent, any problem in their laptop, they just replace..They dont fight like HP. BEWARE, if u want to save 2-3K...u will end up crying.

You should have an option for Return not just Exchange or give a free troubleshooting service.Even though I have bought an extended warranty, I don't have the time to wait and call for service every few days.

"Lap seems sooper smooth while initial setup. Doesn't felt any lag issue like other people claim in their review.. not much satisfied about battery life , thats y 4 giving 4 star. Bt overall it is the best one available in market for this price range.. i opt to purchase this one after 10 days of enquiries and web searches.. it doesnt make me disappointed.. thanks to amazone.. in hp support ,found it is a genuine lappy 😍Review after 2 months -. I just gave one more star and now it is 5 star. Overall pefomance is awesome.. only one problem when creating new folder it lags ore few sec.  Those who felt the system is slow, kindly uninstall useless pre-installed softwares especially mcafee antivirus and install avast free or any other antivirus.. now your problem solved.. u can have a sooper smooth lappy.. enjoy 😍🔥
"
"Very bad experience.  System is booting very slow. Bigger than mentioned. No performance of 8 gb. Requested for replacement.  Amazon denied it. Asked me to go to service centre.  Same day of delivery I am asked to go to service centre to repair.
"
"I like the laptop it has an SSD+HDD option and RAM upgrade option I have upgraded with 256 SSD and 8 GB RAm Now laptop has 16 Gb RAM with 256 GB SSD for OS and 1 TB for Storage. laptop work flawlessly... Awesome purchase.
"
"If you are looking for a no-frills laptop, this is the one. Looks ok, works like a charm, good keypad and overall ticks all boxes. If you compare it to a laptop twice its price, obviously you will be disappointed. This is a WagonR and looks and works like one .  Do not expect to work and look like Honda City or anything higher. Period.
"
"Good packing from Amazon... neat and safe... immediately after receiving I thought it was refurbished... but after using for a month... I feel it is a good product... battery and sound quality is satisfactory
"
"I purchased this item 28th January but due to some argent work I could not use it within return time. This is defected product . Some keys are not working. And very slow process
"
"This is the best laptop in budget range with good battery back up and light weight. I am using Photoshop, image ready and premier without any lag. I bought 8GB varient which helping me boosting performance. I was using Lenovo G560 model with 8GB RAM but it weighs more.  Conclusion: Go for this laptop if your budget is within 35k.
"
"All is well so far.Fast Boot up.Awesome HD Display.Smooth and Great Performance.Nice Keyboard.Good Quality Sound.Cons1. No Touchpad Disable Button. Even in Driver Manager disable option is not present.2. Only one partition and in that Windows is installed.
"
"Don't know whom to blame the HP guys or the delivery retailer or Amazon people. The product delivered we believe was an refurbished one and not a new product! The laptop started giving issues in the months of service itself. Seems to have some battery issues as even getting charged for the whole day  did not last for a hour.Please don't buy this product
"
"MS Office is not pre-installed..... And amazom Show's it was pre-installed!
"
"Good laptop at a reasonable price. But laptop was performing slow when I was using the pre-installed trial version of Mcafee. After I uninstalled Mcafee and installed another antivirus named Comodo, it started working fine.
"
"I purchased this leptop under 34k in freedom sale , which contains 256gb SSD 8gb ram and Intel hd 620 graphics which makes this Laptops l awesome.. only one problem is that, I don't know how to partitions c drive without formatting.
"
"After using the laptop for 7 days:Packaging and delivery:Pretty ordinary packaging and no manual for laptop.Pro's:1.Build quality is good and looks premium.2.Easier to carry with light weight.3.Audio and sound quality is good and is audible in an empty room easily.4.8 GB ram version takes pretty much less time to start and loads fast.Cons:1.Display quality is pretty average,colors are not clear.2. No MS office, with windows 10.We need to enter product key after few days which is bad. Should have given MS office.
"
"I just received this laptop today (I'll update this if there are any issues). And so far, it's amazing! The sound quality is pretty good, and so is the display. I feel like it could've been better if the keyboard was backlit, but that wasn't a priority. Overall, it's a well functioning laptop if you're not a heavy gamer or don't need a laptop for serious coding. It's great for everyday use (though it doesn't have office so that's a drawback). The keyboard quality and mouse smoothness could've been better, but they're not bad (pretty good). If you need a budget laptop for everyday use, definitely go for this.
"
"Battery life is good good product
"
"Home use, private use, perfect for me, was special offer, all in all best price in town, works like a bomb, all good so far
"
"Very nice laptop. The i3 processor in this laptop and 8GB ram handled all the day-to-day tasks perfectly but gaming is very bad. After installing some apps the os was slow. But for normal use, this is a great laptop.

"Good laptop... though a bit too large to carry...the topmost keys on the keyboard are small and given the fact that the keyboard has lots of space, they could have easily put larger size keysThe cover of the laptop tends to show the fingerprint marks and smudgesMS office is the student version and doesn't have all features.Except these negatives, I found the laptop fairly good for routine work purpose
"

Never responded though i have tweeted them also for same.Customer service executive suggests to keep the updated off or the speed of the system will slow further.My past experience with Lenevo and Acer were so good. I regret for trying HP laptop. Wont buy HP products in future for sure.

"First time they delivered the laptop the display was defective as it had keyboard imprints in it.otherwise i really like the laptop but i won't say its the perfect ever.Pros.1)Light weight, compact and has premium look.2) Amazing backlit keyboard.3)good 1080p display4)SSD+HDD+8gb ram which makes it Superfast as well as super useful to store data.5)Decent speaker which is becoming increasingly rare to find.Cons.1) low battery life.2) Does get heated up quickly.i purchased this for academics and coding so i dont regret my purchase at all. but delivering faulty display one first and then replacing to get a new one was a bad experience as i couldn't complete an assignment on time because i didn't have a laptop at hand.
"
"It is a bad experience with this laptop twice..I have purchased this laptop second time after the replacement of the first one. Both were facing the same issue of keyboard marks inside the screen..,
"
"Great product from HP. Got this for 1k less price than here from HP website and also got a free laptop bag. Delivery was super quick (Blue dart)Loved the laptop overall. The SSD makes the experience super smooth. However the keyboard looks cheap and shoddy. Buttons on the chiclet keyboard are clicky and might be announcing to few. Display is great so far, just been a week.Will post a complete review after a month. So far, this is the best non-gaming laptop (from my research) under 55k.

"If you are looking for laptop for study purpose this is very good for you. Every thing is taken under consideration, it's look is really adorable, 4-5 hrs battery life very good sound quality. You are getting intel i-5 processor, window 10 home addition.so far i found every thing well and good about this. Yaa if you are looking for gaming laptop I won't prefer this.

No Dolby.No DVD drive, 2 STD USB 3.0, 1 USB Type C, RJ45, SD Card Reader, 3.5mm Jack, Locking port probably for office purpose.Very fast and smooth and lightning speed boot.Comes with MS Office Home & Student --> only access to word, powerpoint, excel and onenote.Screen can be tilted only 120 degree not 180 or 360I had been using it for more than a month.My usage was mostly on developer tools , some browsing and movies, it can smoothly run an ide , dozen of chrome tabs, a local database instance. Did not give a try with Android studio. My previous i3 machines with 4gb ram used to struggle for this usage. This one seamlessly able to work.Regarding windows updates , got a couple of updates on windows and driver updates from hp. Updates installed perfectly, no issues on updates.

"I bought this laptop (HP 14q cs0018-tu) for 19k INR in July 2019 on Prime day. It's really fast because it has an NVMe SSD with read speeds exceeding 1 GB/s! Windows 10 boots in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the cheapest laptop with a fast NVMe SSD (Toshiba KBG30ZMV256G). The Kaby Lake-R Pentium Gold processor 4417U has 2 cores and 4 threads and is more or less equivalent to a Core i3. The laptop is thin and light, and the keyboard is decent. The charging brick is also small and portable with sufficient cable length.The major downside is the screen which is a sub-Full HD (1366x768) panel, but that's quite OK considering the price point. The other downside I noticed is that the two speakers are not symmetrically placed, but that's just nit picking.Overall, I'm really happy with this laptop. It's great for web browsing, productivity/office work, and light programming.  Easily the best laptop in the 20k INR segment and will handily beat more expensive laptops that have a 5400 rpm HDD.
"
"First of all, I got this for about Rs 19200 and I will be  reviewing as per that price.The body is plastic but not that shiny plastic HP usually provides that gets scratched easily.1. Display is Fine. Not too good or bad.2. Keyboard is fine again. No backlit keyboard as expected for the price.3. Mouse pad is a bit slow but you can always increase the sensitivity.4. Gesture support is there.5. Battery Life is good. I charged the laptop to 100 and watched Netflix offline for 2 hours on full brightness and earphones. The battery then dropped to 85. SO YOU CAN EXPECT GOOD BACKUP6. GAMING: I played basic games like GTA Vice City and it ran fine as expected.7. SSD: OMG! This makes a huge difference. The PC boots in about 5 seconds. Even though the storage is only 256GB but it is worth it as it makes the laptop faster that my other HP with i5 8th gen processor8. You get 2 USB 2.0, 1 USB 3.0, 1 Ethernet, 1 HDMI, 1 headphone jack, 1 SD card reader as ports.9. Speakers are good. Not too loud nor too tiny.10. I think it has a small fan. I did not face any heating issues.11. Webcam is there of OK qualityOverall a very good buy under 20K. I would definitely recommend this product
"
"Got this for 19k on prime day deal. Good laptop for school students. 256gb ssd, reasonable processor 4417U which is power efficient. RAM is 4gb, I will upgrade later. Resolution is only 720p, but can't complain at this price.Overall highly recommed this. Looks and feels like premium laptop.Windows 10 is great. This laptop does not come with latest 1903 build. Easily updatable via windows update.First thing you do after setuo, uninstall mccafe software. No need for it, use windows defender, built in antivirus software.Also uninstall other crapware like dropbox, hp apps etc.
"
"Just received the laptop. Everything is  expected. Display so smooth and sharp. Loving it. Windows and office both got activated. Thin & really light. Booting is slow actually don't know why. Will write a review again in couple of days. Go for it!
"
" I had great hopes from this laptop. And I really needed it to work as expected, as a laptop is crucial for my business. But it stopped working within 4 days of receiving and now I'm stuck, for god knows how long.I hope it gets more negative ratings to show everyone what it truly is....garbage.Bottomline: Avoid buying cheap laptops from Amazon.You get what you pay for!
"
"Pros:- This is a good entry level laptop with super compact build quality- Very light laptop and easy to carry- The keypad is great, comes with 1-month subscription of McAfee and also comes with Office 2019 School edition- Sound quality, picture quality are all top class. Very good for home usage and light office work- Good options on the touchpadCons:- No touch screen- No backlit keyboard- No extendable memory slot to raise to 16 GB RAM
"
"Faster than the high end laptops. it is because of SSD technology used.Tried watching 1080p videos from youtube. no lag in anywhere.sound quality is good in headphones. speakers are ok for normal use.boot time is at its best. less than 10 seconds.battery lasts more than expected. around 4-5 hours for moderate use.no cd drive is there. that is not required nowadays. so not an issue.windows 10 home and student is installed and activated for lifetime.no heating spotted during the operation. this is because of SSD i think.webcam is good for normal chats. not a HD one. but still good.display is not HD. but still good for watching movies.never tried playing any games.weight is less compared to other laptops in this range.one downside is the office version is trial only. need to pay around 8k for lifetime license.PS:please uninstall the mcafee and other junk softwares first on first boot itself. windows defender is good enough to protect the pc.Price is oscillating in amazon. track via eoffersindia to get the price drop alert and then buy.

Please beware of that.Pros:1.Thin2.Handy and weight less.3.Full HD.4.Sound is good.5.Fast/Prompt Responsive.6.PCIe NVMe SSDCons:1.No Keyboard Back light.2.No DVD Writer.3.Microsoft Product activation not working properly for few devices.4.When using high volumes, speakers getting cracking sound.5. No VGA slot. (Very few people still use, not much issue).6. No USB C-Port.7. No USB 3.1Let's see how it work's moving ahead.Overall Best Buy for working professionals with decent performance because of 256GB SSD PCIe NVMe SSD.

"Bought this as my back to college laptop and it didn't disappoint. My all friends are considering this I just bought another 1tb ssd with this and whole set up just took off.Played whole assassin's Creed black flag a little lag but certainly playable.Also all of my engineering softwares run smoothly never experienced any lag(except sucky WiFi at my college)Overall best laptop for 20k and buy another HDD you've got production power house in budget.
"
"It was delivered as oer promised date and product was in good condition. I am hoping HP is good brand and recepient will make best use of same
"
"Great laptop for the price. Got it at19.5k. Battery life is decent about 6-7 hours, feel and finish is pretty decent. Great SSD which makes it real fast, boot-up time is 12-15 seconds.Negatives- Keyboard is just okay and HD resolution, but at this price, these cons are well acceptable.
"
"Probably the first one to review the 4GB RAM, 256GB SSD model.Got this on Independence day sales for 30,390 with 10% instant discount on SBI card. For people wondering about the performance, it has 256Gb SSD which makes the performance and boot up faster than the 1Tb HDD model. It's perfect for home use and student use, not for gamers or photoshop.My advice go for it, if you belong to the above usage categories as this is the best config available at this price point. SSD over 8GB RAM and 1TB HDD anytime, because you can always add extra RAM and have a portable HDD if needed.
"
"The product is not good. Start lagging from the very first day. It Look beautiful but it doesn't work beautiful. Yeh toh tatti hai. And you can't even return it🤷‍♀🤷‍♀🤷‍♀
"
"After using a month I can't stop myself  from writing a review. Due to SSD the laptop become a rocket. Wow !!Please note that it's not a gaming laptop. But best for the normal official work,web browsing, simple editing etc.
"
"Screen is really good... Display is just awesome... Laptop is sleek and lightweight... However the battery backup is pathetic... At the best 3-4 hours maximum... Comes with a 30 day trial McAfee anti-virus free... So be careful if you are installing any other anti virus software... Ensure you de-install the McAfee anti virus completely before you install any other ant virus software... Else the system crashes frequently... Had a similar problem and then had to restore factory settings... Overall a good laptop but needs a better battery backup
"
"Good product for basic usage. Feels lightweight but performance is sturdy. Battery is good. Genuine windows 10 is a bonus at this price point. 😊
"
"Go for ssd laptops.very high performance speed. Win10 loads in 5-10 second with Kaspersky internet security. I3 and i5 are over priced. You won't notice any delay with processing speed. It's at par with i3 processor. Also as it's sdd weight is very light. Go for it.
"
"Everything's good performance,sound,display not for gaming though super comfortable slim and light
"
"The laptop has a hardware problem surrounding the CPU usage. From the day I have bought it, I am seeing a 100% CPU usage for Skype and Windows Explorer running in my laptop. I think this is a very minimum that one would expect to run smoothly, but the laptop gets heated up and it doesn't respond to any clicks. From next day onwards laptop is started auto-repairing, auto-fixing by itself. Cannot open the laptop till today. Horrible experience after buying this.
"
"Amazing product and has a stylist look to it. Photography is my hobby and I bought this to meet my needs of sharpening picture on Adobe Photoshop. But ever since I start editing my pics on Photoshop the systems works surprisingly slow for a i5 with 8 GB. Expected better performance.
"
"Good specification from world brand HP, licenced Windows 10. Suitable for colleges students. cost effective, only problem is MS Office trial version for 30 days
"
"Hello readers, reviewing this laptop after 5 days limited usage. hope you find my review helpful to make decision..1. Very light weight, as good as mac...!!2. Incredebly fast... it having SSD... Windows 10 boots in less than 5 sec..!!3. Keyboard quality also good, Sound quality also very good with stereo effect.4. Looks premium product.. Build quality is very good.5. It is a new generation's lappy, so having inbuilt battery, so no user serviciable part inside..6. Pentium Gold Processor which is as good as Core i3 + 4 GB RAM + 256 GB SSD + Windows 10 Licence Copy... Bang for the bucks...!!!A decent laptop for your basic work like ms office, internet surfing, youtube, etc. Please note the config is made for normal office use so dont except to autocad, minitab to run on this. Also it is not made for gaming like nfs the run and all.If you are clear about your use and exceptions, this laptop is CHota Packet Bada Dhamaka...I purchased this in only 20K in Great indian Sale. and what you are getting in this prise?? Brand like HP along with SSD. Compared to traditional SATA HDD it makes huge diffanance. So fast for working, premium feel, Lightweight like Mac.. Must buy... If you are like to dump all the gigs of movies into your laptop, you can purchase external usb drive for that purpose. For our daily usage SSD making huge diffarance than HDD.  also it having 2 USB 3.0 ports making faster file transfer within compatable devices.Please note this dosent have DVD-RW Drive, Battery also non-removable, Laptop Bag also not provided.I am very happy with my purchase.. Thanks amazon.in for making my day....!!
"
"Excellent Purchase ...Reliable Brand ..Smooth OS.. Got it for 21k ....Looks like a Good Deal 🤗
"
"Battery life last 2 or 3 hours max as normal uses,  screen quality little bit lighter,  weight is fine as per the mention but I got only laptop and charger nothing....very simple, no bag etc. And also packaged was worst and simplicity just cover up by cartoon .....but I'm happy doing offer I got this for Rs.19.999 in range this stuff is good but if the is higher than 20k then don't go for this stuff.
"
"Boots up in max 5 seconds due to ssd.Very nice windows 10.4gb ram enough..Rest is fine..Good for students...I do programming and daily stuff like reading pdf and watching videos.It works like a charm.Bought it in 20k.Really good value for money product.Completely satisfied!
"
"1. It takes only 4-5 sec to on the laptop and ready to work for.2. External hardware is made of very lower quality plastic.3. Screen Color is ok, don't expect much more in this price.4. very light weight.5. Battery backup is quite nice.6. For MS office, i will recommend to buy a genuine office from snapdeal.com for ₹ 700-900 range.7. Battery is not removable like any smartphone today. For replacement of battery, you have to visit hp service center.
"
"Very good works as expected. I never expected Windows would be this good. I am also using a Macbook Pro and it seems both are at par in terms of speed. The resolution is just okay and works for me as i don't need high resolution screen. I am using it just for my personal use and no high processing application.
"
"Light for carry like a Book/copyDisplay have the minimum colour quality,Light speaker sound,
"
"To start with the price point ...and considering this is <20K, this is one of the smoothest operating laptop I have used in this range. The SSD disk works wonders. Battery backup is pretty good and for house hold requirements and even beyond, this works perfect. The overall build is good and kind of mat finish makes it even better and scratch resistant.Considering 14"" screen, the resolution is OK, sound quality is pretty good. Very good value for money.
"
"Positive reviews of this product are just making you fool. This product is useless. For sure you will regret if you buy this product.
"
"I bought it after checking that it has i5. My earlier i5 hp laptop was good when it came heavy computing tasks. I did a comparison of this one with old laptop by running simple excel aggregation functions. This one stood out in the test. So frankly I was happy initially.But then when I used it for operations that took hours to complete I saw that it froze frequently. The CPU hits 100% pretty fast. I guess the freezing is due to overheating. The exhaust ducts are placed in a such way that they get completely covered when flap is down. That could be reason.Otherwise it works fine.
"
"I got this laptop for about Rs. 16.2k - combining exchange and festival offers. The smart thing that HP did with the laptop is replacing the standard 1 TB HDD generally available at these price points with a 256 GB HDD. For most home purposes - light office work and streaming - this is actually the better choice. The SSD has given it better battery life, the laptop is pretty lightweight and suffices for all homely work. Combined with a pre-loaded Windows, this is a steal at this price.
"
"Black dotted line on screen within 15 days use .Worst product
"
"the laptop is really good and the delivery was also fast but i did not receive an invoice for my product
"
"Hello, I have bought this laptop during Amazon sale by exchanging my old dell i3 laptop which is the best deal. I must say boot up and shut down is super fast due to SSD. My usage is very minimal such as web browsing, watching movies, using MS office etc. for which it's a perfect buy. I am also using external hard drive to fulfill my additional need for space. If I compare it with my old dell Vostro 3446 laptop then it's a great value for money.
"
"Just received today. At first I wasn't impressed with the product as it is average in look because I was planning to go for natural silver colour but unfortunately by checking out price with ssd, I choosen to buy this one rather than wasting another 10-15k. Performance wise product is great. Battery life is also good. Screen resolution will is average. Overall value for money. No other product or brand offer same configuration at such an amazing price point. Got it in 18240.
"
"I ordered this laptop for 18k (with Bank Offer) during the Great Indian Festival Sale. The laptop was delivered the next day and the packaging was great, too. Following is my review after using it for 15 days.Performance:This is the only laptop that comes with an SSD at this price point, and trust me, it makes a huge difference in the responsiveness of the system and the boot up speed. Windows boots in 4-5 seconds, apps such as Microsoft Word, Chrome, etc. start instantly. The Pentium Dual Core comes with hyperthreading, which means 4 logical cores. It is a decent performer when it comes to Web Browsing, Word Processing, Video Playback, etc. The best part is that although it comes with 4GB of RAM out of the box, it can easily be upgraded to 8 or even 12GB, since one RAM slot is empty. It also has a slot for a 2.5 inch drive, so another SSD or HDD can be added if the 256GB doesn't suffice. Word of advice: The laptop does come with a ton of bloatware, so be sure to uninstall the needless games and software.Build Quality:It definitely feels like it's a more expensive laptop than it really is. Although the chassis is made out of plastic, it is very good quality. There's very little flex on the keyboard deck as well as the screen. The keyboard keys feel tactile with good travel and the trackpad offers accurate tracking with reliable gesture control.Media Consumption:The screen does go decently bright but the colours aren't as punchy as I'd like. The 14 inch display is a good size. Also the resolution is limited to 1366x768, but at this price, I guess you really can't complain. The laptop doesn't break a sweat even when playing 4K Videos, locally or YouTube, so you can always use an external display  with the peace of mind that the hardware can handle it. The speakers get loud and stay clear even at high volume. The bass is a little lacking, though.Battery Life:On light to medium usage, such as YouTube video playback, web browsing, word processing, etc I got around 6-7 hours of battery on a single charge. The laptop also comes with fast charging, so it can be charged from 0 to 100 in under 2 hours.Final thoughts:This laptop was meant as a replacement for an old desktop computer for my dad. We're both very happy with the purchase. If you're in need of a secondary PC or are looking for a computer to replace that old desktop your parents are using, this laptop should definitely be taken under consideration. Be sure to buy this laptop during a sale, since this particular configuration which is normally available for 25k, goes down to 20k. A bank offer only sweetens the deal further.
"
"The screen quality and the battery life is good. It doesnt come with pre installed windows. You need a product key to unlock. It is very light weight, easy to carry around for travels. I got the laptop for 23,000rs in amazon sale. However, I feel I overpaid for the product.
"
"I'm very much satisfied with this laptop. The booting speed, application speed (daily use application like browser, etc.) Battery life is outstanding. Very comfortable for daily use, especially for typing, browsing, reading books and taking notes. Bought for 13k during Amazon sale, I'm more than happy.Bonus point: Got it from Appario seller which is a genuine product.
"
"Awesome built at this price range 18k with NVME SSD boots with in 2 sec...it's doesn't feel like low pentium processor Its like regular i3 i5 with HDD Even slower then this pentium with NVME SSD . though i3 i5 is more processing power
"
"A value for money laptop with new pentium gold processor and SSD.
"
"Firstly this laptop is very light.The processor is very fast with SSD.I installed Ubuntu on it but the wifi drivers are not available on Ubuntu.Only downside is display which I can't complain at this price.Build quality is sub optimal.Overall fantastic deal.
"
"Just Amazing, I bought in prime day sale at 18k, i am first time user, purchased for normal office work, after three days use, it's superb in all aspects. Thank you Amazon.
"
"The laptop is basic grade with basic processor and build quality also very basic. It is worth the money if priced around 19000 at which amazon has been selling it for quite sometime now. Recently they have increased the pricing to as high as 28000 which is definitely not worth the price. Check out other ecommerce websites as same model with AMD processor is still sold at prices nearing 19000.
"
"I bought it with a price of rs 19000. With this price range, I would say this is the best laptop. Don't search the Internet, go for it. It's an excellent choice. The laptop is fast and comes with an installed windows Os. What more can I ask for? Best buy so far
"
"This is a very good product by hp.Latest CPU,OS,SSD,DDR4 Makes this Device very fast.You can buy this Note Book for your Secondary  Work Device for Heavy User, Primary Device for Students,Normal Business persons..
"
"Not at all a good one.  Poor speed. Keys are hard.  Not come with pre-installed MS Office, for which you have to spend extra.  Overall my old Dell was better than this one.  Wrongly exchanged hoping for a better performance.  THE REVIEWS ARE ALSO APPEARS TO BE FABRICATED.
"

"Excellent product. I never imagined i would get such a product in Rs 19,900/- only. Thanks to great indian festival sale. The only drawback i find is lack of CD drive in it. But this deficiency can be made up by purchasing external CD drive.

"
"Go for it without any doubt  . Its light weight laptop with long battery life. 256gb ssd boost the system speed. Highly recommended.
"
"It has met my expectations, in terms of speed, form factor, display quality. I am enjoying it.I have only one small issue - the power button is too small and one is not sure if it has been pressed properly to power on.  The Led indication light is on the side, and one has to bend sideways to check if it has been powered on.
"
"Fully satisfied . Excellent product as described. Speed is very good. Look wise elegant. Light weight and very convinient to handle. Useing for the last one week.Overall an excellent product.
"
"A really really good deal.Super boost to productivity.Instant app launches and boot ups.The NVME will never let you down.Massive bummer for gaming though. So, dont buy if that's what you have in mind.But, this is one of the best decisions I've ever made.
"

"This laptop was priced around 20000 and a lot of purchase happened around this price margin and all the positive reviews above are made during that period.And as an advantage of those positive reviews and increased demand the Amazon has increased the price margin above 25k which is not at all worthy for this product. This product is best on 20k and average on 22k margin and above 23k it's not recommended so go for some other product.

But it stopped working within 4 days of receiving and now I'm stuck, for god knows how long.I hope it gets more negative ratings to show everyone what it truly is....garbage.Bottomline: Avoid buying cheap laptops from Amazon.You get what you pay for!i want for replace i look 4/1TB but amazon sent the item 4/256GB only you know very well today 256GB not kch nhi hager muhje 4/1Tb mita h to m uske islye aur paise dene k lye ready huamazon HP ki market m value khrb kr rha h.so ilsye dear sir apko kch krna pdega nhi to ak time esa aayega jab HP koi nhi lena kyuki m phle bhi HP tha mere perilsye mne HP ko liyabut amazon esa nhi chahata ilsye apko sochna pdega.

"I Ordered this lap on 17 sep and received on 21 morng.Worst delivery experience by amazon. And coming to the laptop its amazing even Better than my expectations.AMD Ryzen 3 awesome processor definitely lot better than i3 series.Its good for gaming im using it for almost 3 days its performance was very smooth and quick , im starting to wondering how they gave it for 28000. dell ryzen 3 laptop are giving it for 40000.Ryzen is giving pure graphical performance.If ur looking for midrange gaming laptop go for its best in this segment. Some guys are giving bad reviews about that dont get confused.If u utilities its full hardware and software facilities thn ur gng to love this.ill give some additional informationPros:1 Amd ryzen processor its have better multi thread performance when compare to intel i3good for gaming2 Performance u can run highend game's in this.if u upgrade ur ram to 8 GB it will run like a pro3 you have m2 slot for SSD4 Fast charging it takes around 45 min to charge 50% and battery is inbuilt5 its coming with Windows 10 life time validity.6 Comes with DVD drive and smooth finished coating.7 Light weight only 2 kg8 Price Best in segment.Cons:1 just a HD display not FHD2 Battery last upto 7 to 8hrs apprx in gaming  6 to 7hrs3 Yeah its Heating up little bit but not much.if ur well-known guy abt processor u come to know that heating and battery fast draining its a major issues for AMD.its default but im not worrying abt that .intel also have a heating problems and Ryzen is a next level processor from amd its handling heat and battery quite good compared to other AMD.laptop so don't worry abt heating.I strongly recommend this for u too

"This laptop was great value for money Since I exchanged my old laptop. If you can buy this laptop under 23k , just go for it. You won’t regret it. There are many upgrade options available for this laptop So that you can improve the performance of this laptop. I didn’t find any other laptop where I can upgrade to Nvme m.2 SSD.So I was testing my laptop for the last few weeks without the upgrade and it was performing well. But there was some issues with the gaming, Photoshop and continues browsing with many tabs opened.Then I upgraded to WD green m.2 240Gb SSD (sata speed) and migrate the Windows OS to the SSD with the WD OS Clone tool which is available on the WD website. It did shows a significant improvement in the performance. The browsing, photoshop cc speed increased but not the gaming fps. Bought it form Md computers (online) for Rs 3500.If you have the budget go for Samsung 970 evo( Samsung 860 evo for low price).The boot time was reduced to 10sec, for HDD it was around 26sec , for SSD it was 16 sec.I tried to play GTA 5 on SSD , the loading time was reduced but it’s not playable even at lowest graphics settings.Then I upgraded the ram since 3Gb of my ram was always used by the OS, So I installed ADATA 4GB DDR4 2400Mhz ram for Rs 3000 , it really improved overall performance of the laptop. Ram is now running on Dual channel.The laptop came with Samsung M471A5244CB0-CTD Ram which was capable of running at 2666Mhz ,but the laptop motherboard only support 2400Mhz Ram. I opt the help of HP forum and a computer expert to find the best compatible ram for the laptop because there is a chance of some compatibility issues.I would say if you are buying any other ram other than ADATA  AD4S2400J4G17-R , Make sure that you take the laptop to a technician so that even if the ram doesn’t support you still won’t loose your money.I tried to buy online, but if it doesn’t support means I can’t return the product.Now I can play GTA 5 with average 30fps at low settings,No photoshop editing lag ,applying filters and other effects.Pros:AMD RYZEN 3 performance is very goodCan be upgraded to nvme m.2 SSD (Samsung 970 evo the best)No overheating issues.Good viewing angle.Activated windows 10 HomeFast chargingCons:Battery life max 4hrsTouchpad not preciseNo backlit keyboardSpeakers averageRam and SSD slot not easily accessible

"I have upgraded the RAM to 8 GB. The RAM specification that you need is DDR4 2400 Mhz SDRAM. There are 2 slots, so adding another RAM isnt an issue. Dont try to open the laptop yourself as its not easy, take it to someone who knows HP laptops well. The responsiveness of the laptop has improved tremendously with this RAM addition. In case someone needs further enhancement of the performance, I would recommend adding an SSD as M2 slot is available but I didnt find the need as of now. Adding the picture of the RAM that I installed

"Pros:Ryzen 3 with Vega graphicsSupport up to 16gb ramDedicated M2 slot for ssdPreloaded OSAll the needed portsValue for money bought it for 22k after all discounts.Con:Worst screen of allVery slow HDDExperience and suggestion:On the initial days the performance was ok and sometimes slow.Uninstalled Mcafe and using windows defenderBest part is having addition ram and m2 slotSo 1st installed 8gb ram but didn’t see any performance improvement.Then went with 240gb wd green Sata 3 sad and cloned the os there voila OS loads in a second.So at 30k now have 12gb ram 240gb ssd 1tb hdd ryzen 3 what else u can ask.

"Before buying this laptop, I was using a notepad that would last over 8 to 10 hours when fully charged. So, this time, I was looking for a laptop that could stay up and working for a good amount of time. This product - HP 15 AMD Ryzen 3 15.6-inch Laptop (4GB/1TB HDD/Windows 10 Home/Sparkling Black/2.04 kg - is being sold promising that it has 13 hours long battery. Well, that is absolutely false. I am a writer. So, my basic needs (applications) on a laptop/computer are - Ms Word, Ms Excel, Paint, Google Chrome, Firefox Browser. I barely watch movies/YouTube on it. I don't play games on it. But, it's battery exhausts in just 5 to 6 hours. Talking about other features, it is very quite fast. If you have got fast data connection, websites will load in a blink. Sound quality is great. When I received this laptop, I played a few songs on it. It was an awesome experience. But, my friends, if you are looking for a laptop with a long lasting battery, this is certainly not a good to go option.

"Best thing about this laptop is processor which performs almost the same as i3 8th gen at a significantly cheap price. Got it for 22k. 3k extra for 4gb ram Module as 4 gb is not sufficient for Windows 10. Many who complained about laptop being slow should upgrade to 8 gb. It has changed the response drastically. No more hang ups. Adding a ssd could do wonders though have not added one yet.Edit. Finally decided to add a ssd drive. bought WD Green 120 GB M2 drive for Rs. 2280 from amazon. Added it myself. Now the speed difference is apparent in test results. system boots in 15 secs as compared to 40 secs earlier. responses have become much better. the reading speeds are good but writing not so great. I would suggest if you can spend more go for WD blue or Samsung Evo 860. they are more expansive but have writing speeds in the range of 500MB/S. WD Green is for budget users and I feel satisfied with the performance for the price paid.Edit 2 - Many were complaining about battery backup not as expected. Initially when i was using wifi and at moderate brightness i was getting 4-5 hours max. but once you turn off wifi and use it for moderate works like watching movies(not ultra 4k resolution but upto 1080p or 720p) the backup is around 6-7 hours. and while working on word excel etc backup is up to 10 hours usually. Turning off WiFi saves a lot of battery.

"Guys laptop is very good .just buy a 4gb ram and ssd slot then lappy will perform like anything .Wd ssd from amazon is available for 2300 rs buy it but check the version of ssd which fits this lappy.i got it for 22k after cash back worth it.Very fast .Touch pad is good.Battery last 4hrs with full browsing but its got fast charging so its good for me
"
"The delivery was quick , got it for a good price in amazon sale .The laptop looks quite good and also I am able to open laptop with one hand which is great  .Coming to display it's average and can't expect more .The processor amd 3 ryzen 2200 u is good and easily comparable to intel i3 7th Gen .4gb Ram is enough for basic tasks but you definitely need to upgrade to 8gb if planning to do anything more and trust me the performance after that would be great .The additional bonus is m2 slot for SSD , you can install a SSD along with ur 1tb HDD and install windows in SSD and the the magic and speed .One thing I did not like in the laptop is the sound , its low compared to other standards and the sound cracks  in high pitch voices , I ve tried updating the drivers and checking sound settings but no use .Still it's not very noticeable so I passed it and did not return the laptop.If ur looking for a upgradable laptop with good processor under a budget go for it , but only buy it in a sale , never pay 30 k for this .If budget permits definitely concider upgrading to ssd and atleast 8gb more ram , it will give significant speed boost .Have not tried any games , will update after testing

"After Using More Than a Month here is my Review.  This Hp Model only supports Windows 10. You can't install windows 7 you will get an error of Acpi is not Fully support, contact BIOS vendor. (my Bios are upto date as per vendor).For Linux Environment  Wifi will not Supported. You need buy a seperate wifi adaptor dont buy this if you are intend to use for Ubuntu or Kali Linux or any linux environment, Graphics  managable just ok.you will only get 250+MB video Ram which is worst part , you can't work o  adobe programs properly. Battery  backup is 3hrs only. Watched a full movie (2hr15minutes) at 100%  and after finishing 20% remained. Camera quality is GOOD. Display Reflects a lot not friendly. Has some Graphics driver problem which supplier doesn't accept when i gave feedback. You will get bsod error when some applications use graphics (thats not application problem at all ) purely manufacturer defect which they don't accept. Now for the Windows 10 google to disable so much of bloatware which will increase battery and performance. Use the dark mode available in personalization.  My rating 2/5 for medium type users. 4/5 for normal users.

"Price : This is a great laptop at the price offered by HP. 5 full stars. Nothing to beat. It makes it all the more better deal as it comes preloaded with Win10. At 25k deal in festive sale a great price. Performance : The new AMD ryzen processors with Vega graphics match and can even beat their Intel counterparts in performance per watt. However I have no idea why HP and all other manufacturers spoil this performance with Win10 bloatware loaded on an ancient 1TB HDD. Even for a little more a 120GB SDD is so much better. So here 3 stars only for not having SDD in 2018. Have ordered an SDD and have to discard the HDDThe worst however is the screen. I don’t think I have seen more worst screen in my life. My 10 year old Vaio VGN-N31M/W had such an awesome screen. And this is what we have in 2018? Found the reason: this laptop display is 6 bit colour with RBG model. Have to give it 2 stars only ! Can’t replace screen but have to make do with external monitor!
"
"Screen is great .Yet to put an additional 4GB RAM. Removed bloat ware. Installed Firefox only (no chrome) & not using explorer . Did a few tweaks & Laptop starts fast and no hanging. Battery 4 1/2 hours only, but recharging is fast. Bought in the OCT sale @ 21999 (after 2000 SBI card instant discount + Rs 1000 amazon pay cash back) . At this price laptop is better than Core I3 laptops.

"I ordered this laptop on 10 oct and got it on 13 oct but it was  supposed to be delivered on 12 oct.so it was one day delayed delivery..but it is fine no problem.next packaging was very poor..it had no plastic air bubbles  wrapping  and laptop was delivered in rain so it got wet..I was very wooried if the laptop got damaged but thanks to hp pacaking that it was safe.coming to the laptop it is value fir money..I got it in 22000 invluding all discounts so it is best device in this range.sound is a bit low according to me .rest it hangs sometimes due to low ram but if you use an additional 4 gb ram it would work like a beast.display is average.no heating issues tillnow ..and I am satisfied with this.
"
"In this price range HP is providing a good budget laptop... Games can be played casually but not as regular basis... Ram is 4gb, so sometimes it used to hang... Better to put extra 4 gb so that there left no hanging issue. Others editing work can be done smoothly... AUTO CAD 2007 is running smoothly... Even racing game okay but battle field 4 is a bit problem... battery doesnot last more than 2 hrs that to on heavy heavy use it lasts only 1:30 hrs... Screen is awesome. HP service given is good. Inbuilt Microsoft office is there. Even in built Microsoft is awesome... Donot use for heavy games... use only for office work

"Just upgrade m.2 128 gb NVME SSD and another 4 gb ram as I did, and you are good to go. After the upgrade, the laptop boots up within 5 seconds, which is awsome at this price point. The gaming is also decent, with 60-70 fps for modern combat 5. But the battery backup is not as they claim for upto 10+ hours! It hardly gives 4-5 hours. Other than that everything is fine! And yeah the laptop is light weight as well.

"Ryzen 3 is good and windows 10 with ms office is nice. Silver look is attractive and kb mouse works fine. Display looks cheap and viewing angles not good. Little bit heating like 4th generation processors. Battery life is average. Installed another 4gb stick and its performance boosted. I hope again performance will improve after installing ssd as it have m.2 bus. Overall processor is better than i3 7th generation, but gpu is weak than nvidia mx110.Review after 3 months use: Wow, that M.2 port is very good. I have installed a SATA m.2 SSD and laptop working like a charm. Zero lags with Dual core Ryzen 3!! If you wana purchase this laptop, don't miss to install m.2 SSD. I have transferred my Windows10 on SSD, and 1TB internal HDD is for storage only.

"Pros:+good build quality under the category budget laptop/notebook+No heating issues noted (had my fingers crossed until being tested for the heating issue as noted in other reviews prior to purchase)+display and color reproduction was good+touchpad response is quite good.+ Excellent Amazon customer service. (Replacement provided within a week)Cons:- The first laptop delivered had an issue with battery backup, hardly ran for 2hrs30mins. But the replacement laptop as provided by amazon Customer service did quite well of 4hrs30mins backup which by the way is far from what has been advertised as "".....upto 13hrs battery backup""- System gets slower with antivirus software installed

"Value for money laptop from hp. Better to wait for the deals and buy it for 25k. After festival deals are over, the price is showing 32k.Initially it was slow and was taking around 2 minutes to fully load windows 10. After reading rivews and suggestions, i bought additional 4gb ram and 128 gb ssd and installed it. (How to do it yourself and about installation process, you can find in YouTube)Now its booting really fast. Windows load within 25 seconds.So better will be to wait for the good deal and spend rest of the money in upgrading ram and ssd. So finally within 30k you will get a laptop which will be fast enough to compare with i5 powered notebooks. Thanks

"i bought this laptop for my sis birthday,before battery dead my experience with this laptop!!1.AMD RYZEN 3 is good for light gaming, editing and for browsing,and watching movies or online shows.2.BATTERY BACKUP:- if you are gaming give you 1 hour battery backup.document editing or video editing give you almost1:30 to 2 hr,and for browsing give you 3 to 4 hr and last watching online movies give you 4 hr,and watching downloaded movies gives to battery life of 5 hr.  !!BEWARE!! who is planning to buy this laptop after seeing 13 hour battery backup.3:-DISPLAY is the main con of this laptop..ok ok type display,only hd(720p) in 2018.4:-SOUND:- sound output of the machine is good but I'm using DFX ENHANCER,with DFX enhancer sound output is great.5:- PERFORMANCE:-over all laptop performed well if you add m.2 ssd (I added samsung evo 860 evo) for better performance and more 4 GB or more ram(1 extra ram slot available).I added (8+8=16gb)crucial ram coz system supports dual channel ram.after upgrade laptop boot time is drastically reduced from 2 minute to 8 sec...GAMING experience with this laptop is good like PUBG,CS GO,FORTNITE,FARCRY,BATTLEFIELD 1,ROCKET LEAGE,GTA 5,MORTAL COMBAT and more...overall 3.5 rating out of 5.6:-PROBLEM:-within 5 month laptop battery dead, not charging,HP service also sucks!! complaint register on 10th May but still I'm waiting for technician...they are giving same excuse  same time..sir,your problem solved within 2 days but it's already passed more than two days...I already attached pics...so never recommending hp product to anyone else..they are not able to provide services in Hyderabad metro city.. don't buy any hp product... NEVER TRUST A GUY WHO IS TELLING HOW GOOD HP SERVICE....THIS IS EXAMPLE OF HP SERVICE..

"I got this laptop for a steal. I bought it during the Great Indian Sale for only 17000, including 7200 discount in return for my old laptop. It had decent performance, but upgrading ram to 8gb has been worth every rupee. I am able to play graphic intense game like GTA V with almost zero lag or frame drops. If you're a student like me, who games occasionally and needs a laptop for browsing and general usage, go for it. However I would suggest that you wait for a sale or a better offer.
"
"Inspite of increasing the RAM to 8 GB, the speed of the machine has not improved. It's irritating to work on this laptop even for half an hour. Damn slow, Display gets freezed, opening new tab takes time..etc etc. It also have a problem of charging. It doesn't get charged while the lid is in open position. Everytime you have to put the machine in sleep mode to charge the battery. I don't know how and why Amazon sells such junk laptop. Since the replacement window is gone, could not change it. Waste of money.

" Received my laptop. It turned on once fine but after that its not booting up.when i start the laptop cpu fan is spinning at full speed from the first moment and screen is remaining black. Won't even boot into bios. And also i checked for warranty on hp website, it's only showing 9 months remaining of warranty instead of 1 year. So i think seeler tryed to sell the defective returned product to me. Very disappointed.

"I have a YouTube channel and I went abroad trip for like 20 days. I have a good laptop in which I was editing video, but for some reason it stopped working and I only have 3 days left. I searched a lot in mall and Amazon too my budget was so good, because I need some extra money too. Then finally I found this I bought it.Good and fast delivery by Amazon on just next day (Because I have Amazon Prime) my laptop arrived. Battery charging is fast and good if you're using for normal work like typing and browsing. It's handling my editing software's too which is really good for me. Yes it's slow (Of course what you can expect with 28K laptop) but it rendered my 10 min video in just 40-50 mins.One suggestion add extra 4 GB RAM and it will work so good. I was not sure that it will handle latest 2019 editing software's.
"
"Got it for 24k in a sale.Initially, I was using Lenovo z500 which has i5 and dedicated graphics card and surprisingly this laptop beats it in the benchmark. So I can say for sure that its better choice than i3 based laptops any time.4GB of ram is not enough if you want lag-free performance, I upgraded it with extra 4GB of ram and 120GB SSD and after that programs like Photoshop, Android Studio starts up almost instantly, on HDD it used to take at least minute or so and on my Lenovo, it takes significantly longer. There is no competition between my old i5 rig and this one, Ryzen 3 is owning i5 :DBattery Backup is advertised as 10+ hrs but in the real world use, it is giving me 4-5 hrs of web browsing+programming+video playback. Still best in this range.The screen is not FHD and considering price it was expected, it's good enough. I am not a gamer so can't say about its refresh rate but for my use Screen is not bad for me at least.The keyboard is very good, very good for programmers.Speakers are decent, not too good, not too bad.M.2 Slot is a big plus. Just Install SSD and see this thing blazing through anything and everything you throw at it.Ports: You get plenty of ports, USB ports seemed bit tight though. Addition of USB Type C would have been great.Trackpad is good too.

"Writing review after 7 months of use.Brought it on Great Indian Festival Sale at 23k.I usually use it for Coding and currently using Arch Linux with GNOME 3.32Pros:1. Comes with official Windows 10 Home Lifetime license2. Battery backup is good. Can last for 4 hrs with continuous usage.3. In-Built Speaker sound quality and loudness is good.4. Comes with APU. Compute intensive programs can benefit from it.5. Keys are good. Less noise.6. In-Built Camera Quality is good.7. Supports M.2 SSD. Works concurrently with SATA hard disk.Cons:1. Ram is 3.6 GB. Where Windows 10 use 2.4 GB on standby.2. Hard Disk is slow. So, boot time is long.3. F.16 BIOS update broke support for several Linux Distros.4. Due to new Vega Graphics its hard to set up several Linux Distro.In my opinion this laptop is not recommended for Gaming because of it's limited VRAM.One may reduce boot time by loading the OS in a SSD.Games can be played with a RAM upgrade.
"
"I purchased this laptop for 22k after exchanging my old sony viao for the value of 5.5k. What attracted me the most to this laptop was that the extra RAM and M.2 slots with which we can upgrade both.I never really believed in the claim of battery life to be 13 hours. Those who did are those who i consider naive. It lasts for around 3-4 hours of continuous use which i think is fair enough.Day to day apps like MS word and ppt and pdf readers are working perfectly fine as of now. My old sony had become really slow in opening those apps.However, my only gripe as of now is its horrendous display. The screen resolution and viewing angle is pathetic. If you like HD stuffs, please don't bother with this laptop. The screen is not that immersive and over that it is highly reflective, so you can't use it outside in daylight.As a budget option, it is ok, and remember, there is this option to upgrade to SSD and upgrade the RAM.
"
"I am using it for for day to day task. It is exactly as i expected. Upgrades I suggest -1. M.2 SSD - will reduce boot time.2. Another 4GB Ram - will reduce lag.With these two upgrades, It will feel like an XPS or Macbook.If you do not have any requirement related to gaming or editing videos, then go for it. Ryzen 3 and Vega is actually better than i3.
"
"Initially, this was a very decent laptop. After a month of use, it began to slow down drastically. I make it a point to remove all my files every week or so onto an external hard disk to keep the laptop as empty as possible. Even after doing this, it seems to be slowing down gradually. I wouldn't think this is a very long-life kind of laptop. Have even reinstalled the OS on the laptop. It solved the problem for a about a week and then went back to its usual slow self.
"
"Too much slow.. Cant even open google chrome in time.. Unable to update the windows in this laptop.Even replacement is not working properly.. Don't waste money go for Asus or Lenovo instead of HP.
"
"First of all it isself not a complete laptop but it gives you options to make it a good machine. Which you will not get on other laptops under this price.Hardrive is extremly slow. Though it shows it 5400rpm but blevive it works like a 10 years old harddrive worls.Boot is extreamy slow. Takes around 1 minute to turned on completely. (i have. Removed AV and HP product software which comes preinstalled)Copy process is also slow.Good part is : you have M.2 slot. So you can M.2 SSD hardrive for OS and believe me you will see more than 10 times difference in boot time as compared to his own disk.Second good thing is that it has 2 memory slots where you can add up to 16gb memory. I small problem which i noticed is that the memory is ddr4 ram with 2666mhz which higher than what they have mentioned in to the specification. and if you are planning to upgrade memory parallely then please buy a compatible memory.Rest everything seems to be fine.

"I ordered this laptop on 14th and received it on 19th. So average speed of delivery. Now as far as laptop is concerned,it is top notch as long as you dont have sky rocketing expectations.. This is the best laptop below 30k.Pros:1-Ryzen 3 is pretty fast in CPU performance and miles ahead of intel UHD 620/630 in GPU performance.2-Handles all the regular work very well, plays 4k video in youtube without any stutter. I use it for day to day purpose.3-It can handle gaming quite well(at 720p obviously) if you add another 4/8gb of ram as 4gb ram is quite low for playing recent games. 4gb ram is not even adequate for windows 10 nowdays ,leave aside gaming. So if you want good stutter free performance, get atleast extra 4gb ram.4-I have used it for emulation purpose as well and have got very good performance in pcsx2 & cemu( both of which are very cpu intensive). Intel doesnt play pcsx2/cemu well enough even at lowest settings. Intel gpu is not supported by cemu. So if you are into playing retro games and have a limited budget,this is your best budget option.5- Its very premium looking laptop with sparkling black finish.6-Has two USB 3.1 ports which provide very fast transfer speed.7-Has M.2 port(which is much faster than HDD) for upgrading storage which i am planning to do. Shifting the OS to M.2 will give serious boost in performance. Most budget laptop dont have this facility.8-Metallic finish around keyboard which gives it premium look.9-Pretty loud speakers10-No heating(gets just little warm on full load)11-Good screen12-Not very heavy- its 2kg which isnt much considering that its a 15.6 inch screen.13-Charger is very light weight. It becomes important when you are carrying it daily for 1 hour on your back.Cons-1-Pathetic webcam, but thats normally found in most laptop. This is one thing i dont understand that why manufacturers dont add good webcam. Nowdays we have 20-24 megapixel cam in mobiles, so why not add a good webcam in laptop?2-Not so great viewing angles on screen. Also screen is very reflective,so causes problem in day time as lots of reflections create distraction.3- Maybe this problem is with my unit only but USB ports are very tight. I have to struggle to insert or remove any USB cable etc.4-Not soo great battery life as has been claimed in the description. Even when i have used in most economic way possible , i get around 6-7 hours battery life. Though it is much better than normal laptop, but still much less than claimed 13 hrs battery life. Maybe it can be acheived in future by optimization of BIOS or driver.5-Wobbling of screen when it is carried in hand.Overall, its a fantastic laptop for the price. You will be pretty happy if you dont have skyrocketing expectations.

"It's been a couple of weeks since I got this laptop and so far so good touch wood. After 8 years of using a Mac I decided to return back to HP with my first time using Windows 10. I must say I am impressed with its performance so far. The good thing is I can upgrade the RAM which I plan on doing soon simply because I'm a tech geek but in no way does the installed RAM make the laptop lag in any way. The Ryzen 3 processor is also nice and slick too. Just make sure to routinely update the preinstalled device drivers and in order to make sure you get all the device improvements. Overall it's good for work, gaming, web development etc. The battery is quite decent too for such a lightweight lappy.

"Ordered this laptop on the 24th Dec and got it on Christmas Morning!I was expecting the performance to be on the slower side considering that it only has a 4GB RAM on it, but I am pleasantly surprised to see that it is quite fast. However, I will still add another 8GB RAM to make it a total of 12GB, cause that more RAM the better it is.Will also upgrade to the 240GB WD Green M.2 SSD and migrate the OS to it, cause it will definitely boost the performance.Having said all that, I would certainly recommend this laptop cause right out of the box it is great and good value for money. Plus it is highly upgradeable as compared to other laptops in it category and price point.AMD Rocks!!!

Day to day tasks are handled easily with minimal or no hiccups.Upgrading to extra RAM and SSD should help in a much better performance for sure.The battery is pretty average which is okay considering the price point.. Should last you between 3-4 hours on moderate usage.Display is antiglare so no strain on eyes or headaches expected for prolonged sessions.Keyboard is tactile but the placements of keys could have been better.Installed Pub G lite and played one match... It is playable but don't expect buttery smooth performance.. Upgrading ram to 8Gb should help.Dual speakers are adequately loud for a closed room.. The volume from headphone jack is amazing.Overall a pretty solid offering at the current price of RS 28900.. If offered 2k discount during sales then it will be a killer deal.Surely recommended to upgrade by investing 5-6K to SSD and higher RAM.. Will be doing so in diwali time and will post my second thoughts then.

"I had high expectations about this.  After reading all those good reviews I decided to go with It. But Its terrible. First thing that I notice is the display. Its plain bad.  Not at all HD as described. It looks like 360p at the most.The pages are all pixelate.  The display really looks like what people would have used in the eighties,  when Steve Jobs and such visioneries were working  on it.  But It seems this product is yet to move on from that and its stuck to this Damn which might have looked OK 35 years back. Its still under 10 days replacement criteria but the Guys at amazon are not responding well. Then I discovered the second problem, this time one of the keys on keyboard does not seem to work and when I checked,  Its damaged and what looks like a hardware issue. When I contacted amazon, I was told to update the drivers from HP site. Tell me, how can you fix what is clearly a Hardware issue by downloading softwares!!! This IS THEIR SUPPORT or if you may call it that.Yet I installed all the drivers and still hardly any improvement.My Question is - Amazon, What is this!I have been buying  since 2015 using this ONE account, thats more than 3 years, almost overlaps with Amazon's beginning  here in India. SO I do think I deserve better. Thats It

"As reviews say it IS slow. My 2006 build Compaq (XP OS) with just 256 mb RAM used to load image file in millisecond. This one with 4 GB RAM takes about 3 to 5 seconds. That XP OS was of CD size (less than 700 mb). This one's security update alone went to 6 GB.  These days the OPERATING SYSTEMS are heavier and slower. It seems. Must be because of heavy protection mechanisms. I am just a computer user not a technical expert. I don't know what is what. Some said upgrading RAM to more GB speeded it up. For less than 20,000 this laptop is a good buy. Battery lasts upto 6 hours +. Mc Afee anti virus is 1 month  free. With just ₹600 you can buy for 1 year ( choose one device option). Win 10 has ""lifetime validity""USB PORTS TOO CLOSE ??? I CANNOT BELIEVE THIS. SUCH SIMPLE FACTOR THAT HAS WENT UNNOTICED BY HP AND NO FEEDBACK COMPLAINTS ABOUT USB PORTS PLACED TOO CLOSE ON ALL LAPTOPS, ALL THESE YEARS. On the left side, this laptop has 2 usb ports placed too close. You can never put two otg sandisk flash drives at the same time. The first one will block the entry of second flash drive. How they put 2 usb ports that close is a matter of concern and why they were not pointed out by possibly millions of users worldwide. Designers must have separated two usb ports atleast by two or three inches.Make sure to switch on the option not to install any software from outside the Microsoft store. One unauthorized program (not in Microsoft store), can download more programs by itself and ""stall"" the already slow laptop. They happen in background, you don't know what is happening. For two or three days, I suffered moving to every level in minutes time not seconds, switching system off by force pressing the power button on laptop and again restarting. I UNINSTALLED ALL PROGRAMS FROM OUTSIDE THE MICROSOFT STORE. This made the system workable. There is nothing wrong with MCafee anti virus program. It only protects.  There must be a strong reason why HP itself recommends MCafee anti virus.There is no light indication that the laptop is ""ON"" on keyboard. One must press either the caps lock button or mute button to remind that the lap is running. These days people are preoccupied and absent minded. They tend to forget whether they switched the lap off or whether it is ""on"".  The screen display goes blank after few minutes idle period, one must look sideways on the right to see if the light is glowing but most often they don't do it, causing the lap to be running inside for no good reason. A light on the keyboard (near spacebar) would be better for all laptops

"Worst laptop ever I have seen in my life.Please don't buy it...When you right click and click NEW , it immediately hangs and then starts working after 10 - 15 mins............Very bad, on every aspect ,neither good for MS Office use nor for anything else.completely Useless laptop ...... And even Amazon refused to Return or replace the laptop......I have done everything like , updating drivers,Updating software,dial clean up,etc. That amazon agents told me but still this laptop is very slow. This laptop hangs 100 times in a day
"
"First day review. Slow startup. Took almost an hour to do initial set up. Overall there is a slowness. Opening apps and settings taking longer than usual.Good timely delivery by amazon.Will use for some days and try.————Review after 5 days:Slowness continuesTakes lot of time while performing certain basic tasks. Ex below1. Right click from desktop and opening ‘New’ submenu takes around 30 seconds2. Opening multiple browser tabs in chrome makes system very slow3. Settings tab takes around 20 secs to open.Overall not satisfied with the performanceThe positive is battery life.======further update : I have now started facing intermittent wifi disconnection issue———-After using for quite some time now, I am giving a 1 star now as there is no option for a zero star. Utterly disappointed with HP. This is the 7th laptop in my life and the worst one. Agree that the price is less but that does not mean that you can compromise on quality. Still the laptop is dead slow. Takes over a 2 minutes to just open google chrome.NOT AT ALL RECOMMENDED
"
"One practically useless laptop that's good for literally nothing. Will freeze with just 5 tabs in Chrome loading low graphic trading charts. Not good for even using as a word processor - 3  word documents will cause it to continuously freeze. Losing so much time everyday because of this. Made a mistake because I was on a budget. Even if you don't have money and buy this as a budget laptop, please save and buy a better configuration or pay more and use EMI for payback.
"
"Laptop is good but dead slow RAM 4g not enogh.HP should describe required RAM for normal operation.Only started working for normal use after diabling disk write coach and uninstallatio of virus software provided with laptop.. can use laptop for day to day use. Only RAM upgrade to 8gb wil help laptop to normal.

"I'm not a blogger to write about something so intensely to be honest I'll write this one. It's jot that this is the first laptop I've used nor will be the last but I've very bad experience. It says AMD with high speed and so many other positive points but trust me. You'll regret. I replaced twice thinking manufacturing issue but noop. The laptop and the processesor itself is worst. I'll freez you screen, lags, hangs and takes several minutes to start your computer. If u click a start menu itll take 30 sec to open. Don't mention opening 3rd party app. It'll take forever or freezes and the pc will restart itself. Once u connect with Bluetooth device than be ready to press the power button because after 5 minutes your pc hangs and mouse cursor freez and nothing can be done accept pressing power button directly. Took a help from Amazon technicians, Hp technicians but nothing could be done. There are no number of points to mention what is problems. But there are unnamed problems I've never come accross in my computer experience.If u don't truust me in this than later you have no points of getting regret. Don't buy ryzen AMD. Go to intel cores
"
"Very worst product, I just used one da and I updated all the drivers, but still the laptop is very slow and the major thing is I got dot in the display... Which is really very major problem... Display quality is too bad... And now the TouchPad is not working.... I really didn't expect this from HP...
"
"Not deserves even a star it's normally takes 7 minutes to start , I am professional my usage limited to browser, Ms word and watching videos or music though it's take too much time.Upgrading is must or else you feel working in grandpa age also not that easy in this upgrading removing panel is daunting task.My core 2 duo starts and work faster than this , unfortunately I purchased 2 Laptops seeing there endorse of 8 hrs battery etc and it's a big trap.Such big international company HP not cared about it's growing brand in market or trusted customer, just for the sake of selling this junks troubling customers.Go for any other laptops in range of 15k instead of this you will be more satisfied instead of wasting valuable time on this junk.
"
"Very disappointing with the HP laptop . Hard disk got crashed with in year where the laptop usage was  minimalThis product already a problem with Hard disk was crashed within a year of purchase. Which is very disappointing. And it was told that inner boards of the laptop are very old boards, when checked with hardware repair person. But actually we have bought a new brand device from Amazon ,  also this laptop comes with one warranty which is till November 2019,that means the date of purchase was in November 2018 , but the warranty says only till September when with HP company. Miss match of warranty dates

"Not working properly and speed is very slow. Battery life is very short.Amazon is not helping me to return this product.

"On registration on hp site it show 10 months warranty instead of 1 year. Product already registered on hp website before 2 months. How strange

"good laptop in a budget but pretty useless without SSD upgrade and ram expansion. Hangs like anything even with mild browsing and light multitasking .but the good thing is it has m.2 SSD slot and dual channel ram for expansion.  UPDATE:  BOUGHT SAMSUNG EVO 860 OF RS 3999 AND ADATA DDR4 RAM OF RS1599 FROM AMAZON AND UPGRADED IT. BELEIVE ME THE LAPTOP WORKS  LIKE A BREEZE  ,THE BOOT TIME IS REDUCED TO 25 SEC FROM 2 MINUETES AND LOADING TIME IS ALSO QUICK. SO WITHOUT RAM EXPANSION AND SSD THIS LAPTOP IS USELESS WEIGHT BUT WITH IT ITS A BEST IN BUDGET SEGMENT
"
"As most of the points covered earlier - regarding the importance and need to upgrade the ram to 8 gb - else somehow this laptop is much useful ( the OS itself takes close to 3 gb or ram ) - noteworthy I also bought one more Asus laptop same day with intel p - however the battery life and ram usage is much better ( considering its price point and both have same OS / 4gb ram / hdd ) - apart from that I don't see any benefit of this laptop over my other laptop. My usage is usual browsing / movies / bit of office work ( ssh terminals / C programming etc ).However the benefit in gaming is evident - its much better now and doesn't hang/crash.Overall - warranty support is so far good - HP support does hear and try to solve the problem.I guess its imperative that extended warranty needs to be purchased.Hope it helps - Thanks
"
"got the laptop on sale for 22k after all discounts. seems a good value for money product for regular everyday use (not heavy computing or gaming).mcafee seems to be coming preloaded on a lot of laptops these days and it does eat up a lot of cpu and disk utilization and makes the laptop slow/laggy. need to uninstall mcafee and install an alternative like eset or avast.noticed that it doesn't have an easily removable battery (like how most conventional laptops do). one probably needs to unscrew and remove the entire base to access the battery and other components like the ram and hdd. so i wonder if the battery is easily user replaceable... will know once i open the base panel off in a few days.also wanted to upgrade the RAM, but unable to get the exact ram spec (tried the bios and speccy) and it doesn't show a brand name. i guess i'll have to physically open up the base to get access to the hardware and see what i can do about it.definitely would do much much better with 8 gigs or ram and an ssd.
"
"I purchased this laptop during diwali sale. I have been using this now for more than a month and I find it complete value for money.AMD Ryzen 3 processor is better than Intel Core i3.I even upgraded my RAM to 8GB and now all the processes have become very fast. (At 4 GB RAM also the performance was good).Another advantage is the availability of the M.2 SSD slot. No other laptop in this range has this provision.Overall, I will suggest to go for this laptop.
"
"It's a very beautiful product from Hp.... I completely fell in love with the device from the first day.... It's light weight.....On the specs front it has decent processor (ryzen 3) and graphics driver. You can play games easily (not high end). It's a good laptop for engineering students and for general purpose daily use. It has also slot for M.2 drive... So in future I'm planning to upgrade...Ram also is 4gb which can b upgraded to 8gb....Overall the product is fantastic for the price ... And I would highly recommend it.
"
"laptop is good as expected. needs 8gb ram for better performance. there is no extra hdd slot fyi. nothing much surprising about this laptop. got very high fps while playing dota 2. very good. Normal battery life(4 hrs)  normal weight.

"I would like to inform everyone that please please dont buy this product.. I know u are here in need of A cheap and best laptop but this product is really very cheap but this is A worst product, trust me it is far better to buy laptops from their respective stores rather online.. I have bought this product and then I realize why they are selling it for only 19990 it's actual price is 22000 this laptop is an old model of E2 SERIES, so please i request u dont through your money here instead of this you can see it offline ...
"
"Overall I'm happy to have this machine. Just one fear I have is the heating issue of this processor. It heats up too much especially when we do multi tasking for little longer duration. I am hopeful that it'll not create any problem for longer run.Its performance is almost equivalent to i3 but graphical performance like medium load gaming works even better on this one than the i3 processor, but heating is a big time problem. If we do multi tasking especially playing games or watching movies or videos for long time then laptop heat up much. Once I had experience weird problem too when it got too much heat it play weird sound for few minutes and then restarted.Battery life is  not so good. Yes it'll charge very quickly but it'll exhaust like the other hp machines. The claim of having larger and efficient battery life on this listing page is not true at all.
"
"I bought this laptop during the great Indian sale for 22k, it was delivered fast and well. immediately after delivery, I upgraded its ram to 8gb (as win10 is quite sluggish), and started testing it out.I played the following games on it on low settings.1. pubg mobile (emulator)  fps :30-402. csgo fps 30-603. FIFA 18 fps 35-1024. fortnite 33-425. GTA 5 fps 30-456. rocket league fps 907.dota 2 fps 608. dirt rally fps 80-100this shows that it performs very wellbattery charges super fastand drains superfast if you play games , lest it gives long backupdisplay quality is okayspeakers are okoverall good package in 22k

"Good laptop for the price 23000 rupee plus 1000 Amazon cashbacks. So final price 22000 rupees. Good for Ms office and browsing. May not be good for programming using heavy editor like visual studio etc. Light weight, battery backup 5-6 hours with medium brightness. Didn't check gaming and all.
"
"I bought this laptop as it was very cheap and came with RYZEN 3 processor. I wanted mid-range optimum laptop for all the work including daily use and photoshop and after effects. Due to Microsoft Windows OS the lagging is there, however if you add 8GB more to lap of SODIMM 2400MHZ RAM then 12GB in total would help latop do any work you want without interupting other work and distributin of threads for work is awesome and handelled well by CPU.As I do not play games, I do not know how good the graphics part is, however it helps after effects very much faster than my old laptop. Thankx to HP. Thankx for the seller for this price.

"Good product with good pricing, sound quality is high which is good.
"
"while this laptop is only a moderate gamer, one really should not be stepping into a 26k product expecting ROG level gaming. if you want a killer gaming rig, set the 26k asode in your bespoke custom PC fund thst you'll be able to finally cash out three years later. if you just want to build a few houses in Minecraft or Terraria, this will do.the trackpad is responsive and the typing is absolutely enjoyable.Windows 10 has largely calmed down with the updates, and some features are... better... than Win7, as much as I hate to admit it.overall, a solid starter/typist laptop, but splurge on something with an actual graphics card if you want gaming.
"
"Handy and light weight. Serves basic purposes of a laptop. Wouldn’t recommend for gaming though. Ryzen gets you through multi-tasking and can run multiple applications simultaneously.Out of box warranty was 3 months. Spoke to HP and they extended the warranty to one year.MS Office is only a trial version.Decent battery life, typical laptop display. All in all a good value for money buy.

"Hello guys..After 3 days consecutive usage I'm writing this review.What I liked about this product and dislike.Pros and cons..1. For a generic purpose, or learning, education, coding, manual small businesses this laptop is more than sufficient. In terms of build quality it gives a premium feeling which I personally like the glossier look of this jet black laptop.2. Wide screen with less bezels which gives a hepatic feeling for watching videos on YouTube or any other social media. It also gives a very bright colorful eye-catching output for watching movies.3. Now let's talk about inside the laptop..Related to this built in apps, it gives lot of apps for free to use. And most of all the usable and necessary apps are already there which you will need in your daily usage. Like if you talk about Microsoft Edge web browser, it is also very much fast and responsive. Unlike the Firefox it doesn't lag or consume much data.Cons..1. Battery life sucks, I mean really it sucks, less than 4 hours with fully charge. But one thing is good charging time. It gets charge withing 2hours. Thanks to its fast charging.2. Graphics are ok. Not complaining material.3. So many updates for Windows 10. If you have a hotspot it will consume all your data in just one hour.Overall, it is a very good stylish looking laptop.I would recommend you if your budget is less then 30k.
"
"Excellent Product in this Range and its with Window 10, Decent 4 GB RAM extended upto 8 GB with 1TB Hardisk and the processors are also nice. Its Light Weight, supercoo, Looks Smart, Easy to carry. After searching many products in this range i had finally decision about this product. Such a nice product by Amazon and HP. Thank you.

"I got this under 25k . I have been using since 2 months and don't have any issues with it yet. I haven't upgraded the RAM or anything , sometimes starting up can be slow , but for the price , I think this laptop is really worth it.I use it for browsing and other daily tasks.The display is nice and big, speakers are pretty loud enough, even video calls are quite clear. I am very satisfied with my purchase.If I find anything else worth mentioning, I will update this section :)

"The laptop is extremely slow and laggy. The issues start within the first two weeks but in my case they were after the return window. One of the laptops restarts randomly a couple of times each day. The customer care team also is unable to help. The process to contact HP and get the warranty clause activated is painful and so far (30 days+) I have not received the required support. I would strongly discourage anyone from purchasing this product. I was an ardent HP fan but will not be purchasing their products anymore..
"
"The laptop is great except for one item. The keyboard design is really poor. The silver topped keys with grey lettering are near invisible. The Function keys are numbered in miniscule font (that too in grey font). I think the regular designer went on a holiday while the keyboard was being designed.  I really would like to give it three stars only due to this huge factor in efficient usability. You need to have a light shining directly on the keyboard to see the keys properly.  But otherwise the machine is great.

"Update 16-10-18 - alright next update. it works smooth as butter. I will provide some step wise alterations to be made that will speed up the laptop.1.Uninstall Mcafee. Windows defender is capable enough to protect from normal threats unless malicious sites are opened by user. In that case use AVG . its pretty light on RAM2. Then go on control center - windows update and keep running updates,restarts and boot ups until it shows that no further update is available. Similarly do it for HP assistant. It will download all the drivers required for the laptop. This ll eat some 2 hours of time but very necessary.3. Once all updates done - Go to task manager. From there to start up and disable which ever process you don't use like Microsoft one drive etc.4. In task manager go on view tab and update refresh speed to the highest.5. In start bar in computer/ windows management manually update processor speed to 100% while on battery or on AC power.After all these setting you will find laptop boot up real nice in under 30 sec and no lag while operating in multiple windows or videos or heavy word/ excel files.Updated rating to 5 star now11-10-18 What a grt PDT. Crashed within 3 hrs ..So much for comparison with i3 ane i5 . Now amazon won't replace till an engineer visit after 2 days to see wht I posted in here...Ll update after 2 days !

"
"Everything is bad about this laptop. The worse laptop I've used in my life. Takes 20 minutes to open windows 10. Application start after 5 minutes of clicking a mouse button. Horrible. Pathetic. Never ever plan to buy this laptop. HP is just a big brand with substandard product range.

"
"If you like to analyse for hours/days/weeks even, before buying a product, especially the technical stuff, then this review's helpful for you.To be honest, I was super scared to buy this. I know HP has a good reputation, but there was hardly any review regarding this product and not any detailed one. Plus I bought it during Diwali sale so the time was running. And the purchase was to be made in prepaid manner since Amazon doesn't allow COD on products costing this much, and there is no return but only replacement allowed on this laptop, so YIKES! Thankfully I did my homework for whole 2 days, learnt the basics of buying a laptop (type of ram I would prefer. what processor, battery strength, etc.) and searched around a lot and decided that this was the one I could get for greatest value at lowest price (Anyone else who is technologically disabled as I am, please refer to Amazon's laptop buying guide - that helped me a lot to understand what I want on my own and compare various models to narrow down on the one according to my priorities).Quality of laptop:Looks 9/10: I love the silver and textured look that this lappy gives off. The one star I deducted was because I have been told that the keyboard has been an issue for few customers because the letters are printed in dark gray. so there is not much of contrast. This wasn't an issue with me, coz I am already a fast typist and can type without continuously searching on keyboard. Please look at the images of the keyboard I have attached with this review and judge for yourself.Is it a fast laptop?: 9/10 Damn yes! Obviously during the initial setup it took quite a few minutes. After doing that, this lappy is super fast. I am a research scholar. I don't indulge in gaming right now. But I almost always have like 20-30 tabs open simultaneously for weeks or months together. So far, this lappy with its 8 gb ram seems to function efficiently even though I've got 10 tabs open right now. I deducted 1 star because I want to see if this will behave the same way after heavy usage. I will update this again after a few months of usage and change the rating accordingly.How's the battery?: 8/10 It came with a 39% charged one. I charged it to 100% and plugged it out. I have been watching videos online and downloading and browsing study stuff for the past 1 hour and it only reduced to 85% and that is doable for me. Happy with this one, coz no particular specification is mentioned related to battery usage in the specifications except for 3-cell battery mention (I asked my tech friend about this and he had said it should work upto 6 hours with regular browsing). I deducted 2 stars because of my own jealousy, coz another laptop by HP is available in the touchscreen series at same price with claim of 7 hours battery life in average and upto 13 at max. I gave that up for this, because my friend has had a touchscreen one, and the reflective surface is simply horrifying - too reflective, super sensitive, not at all visible from side angles/if you are standing at a peripheral position. Anyway, I hope this one does me prouder. 2 stars deducted also because laptops with 7-8 hours battery life are available at the same price. I will update it again after I check when the battery drains completely after heavy usage.The screen: 9.5/10! The only reason I was hesitant about was because I did not want a reflective surface screen - those are absolute headaches, my eyes hurt plus I get super scared looking at my own reflection after watching a horror movie (ha!). Anyway, this product surprised me with exactly what I wanted - a MATTE screen!! Not a screen skin/guard but the screen itself! In the specifications it was mentioned that a standard LED backlit screen's available, so I thought I was settling. But this was such a pleasant surprise. The matte screen does not reflect, the glare's low even if I increase the brightness plus really contributes to the laptop's aesthetics. Then why didn't I rate this 10/10? Because I am greedy and I really like if when the LCD covers the whole of screen. I am not really fond of the black body around a screen. Basically I like the TV look on a laptop (if that makes sense), a higher screen to body ratio. But at this price? Steal this!Sound: 8/10 The sound is sooooooo much better than I expected. Clear and loud too. I deducted 2 stars, coz well, like I said I am a greedy girl and the louder it is, the better!Ease of navigating Windows 10: 10/10 My tech friend had advised me not to go for Windows 10 coz it lags/hangs. I am super glad that I chose not to listen to him. I have been using Windows 7 professional up to now. So I was a little nervous to switch. But the transition is super smooth. Everything is easier to find and access.MS Office 2019 version: 9/10 I am a PhD scholar. So you can imagine the value of this for me. I wasn't willing to compromise on this version. But when I tried to activate, it was showing that only Office 365 version can be activated on this, nothing about the 2019 version. So I had a mini heart attack. After 5 mins of trying to use Office 365 version though, automatically a notification came up that prompted me to update the current version to Office Home and Student 2019 version (Phew!).I love the Microsoft Search feature they are showing off right now though. I deducted 1 star because I have received this lappy a week ago. I wanna use this for a longer period of time and update in case any issue comes up with this.Why buy this online instead of offline? At the same price, I was getting an offer to buy HP laptop with same specifications except for 4 gb ram and free goodies like headphones, bags, usb lights, pendrives, etc. But those over a 8 gb ram at the same price? Are you kidding me? This is a no brainer. You can buy the goodies yourself for under 1200 INR. But having a new ram of 4 gb difference plus the installation charges that would be charged to change/modify the old processor would amount at least up to 4k. Now it's a matter of priorities. Goodies vs better processor aka speed.I HAD ONE ISSUE WITH MY LAPTOP MODEL THOUGH:On the keyboard. above 2 number button ""@"" icon was made, but whenever I tried to press it, inverted comma/"" appeared and ""@"" appeared when I pressed "" button. I thought this was a malfunction in the hardware? Maybe the icons got misplaced? I know it is a small matter. But oh well, my mind's been wired to the traditional keyboard style and I wasn't looking to experiment with it. After an hour though, it became okay (o.O ??) Like it was supposed to in the first place. This is strange and sounds weird. Anyway, why I mentioned this here is if this happens to you, give it an hour or so and keep using your laptop normally. If it still doesn't get resolved like mine did (by magic?), then do contact the customer support of Amazon or ask for a replacement if it irks you enough.Thanks for reading my lengthy review!

"Overall 1/5 rating. I am working with Amazon to return this PC (not easy to return....pathetic process...they send some1 to check if you are speaking truth or false) because wifi adapter (Realtek RTL 8723DE802.11 B/G/N PCIe Adapter doesn't work on 5GHz Airtel/ Reliance wifi. So if internet goes (obviously its going to happen) faster, laptop is not going to work. Unfortunately this information is hidden and not mentioned anywhere in technical specs. PLEASE DONT BUY THIS LAPTOP. Other cons: Big, heavy, no- touch screen, no SSD, normal HDD.
"
"Decent laptop but the wireless adaptor supports only b/g/n band only. So can connect only to 2.4GHz signal and get max 40MBPs speed. Even if you have a high speed / 100 MBPS connection, you will not be able to connect.
"
"I feel worth buying such a nice HP laptop in that budget.Everything was working fine.Sound quality was good and battery charged with 99% was lasting for 6hrs.I feel I made a good decision by spending money on a good product.
"
"Laptop is good from every angle.  Price is reasonable. However, I had a bad experience with amazon. My laptop warranty started 6 months prior to my purchase date. I wrote to amazon for 9 times. Every time in their answer, amazon gave me promise to sort it out & mentioned that my problem is genuine. After 15 days of my 1st mail they formed committee to sort out my problem. After 1 month,  amazon committee passed resolution that I should contact HP company for warranty & they have nothing to do with my problem. I wrote them, I purchased  laptop from amazon , so  amazon should do correspondence with HP. But amazon did not agree.  Ultimately I started correspondence with hp. HP was very practical & resolved my problem with single mail.
"
"This laptop full series has problem. While creating new folder system it hangs. I returned this laptop twice but still same problem was available.so finally I returned and decided to buy different lappy.  It's speed is not as par with specifications. Boot time is more.
"
"It is a pretty pathetic piece of hardware I have ever used,1. Very poor performance even with 8GB RAM, the laptop takes ages to login and display your desktop. Often, simple programs like Chrome becomes unresponsive. One has to restart the program.2. Keyboard and mouse pad placement are not at all ergonomic and is very uncomfortable to use. The keys are hard to press and not at all intuitive due to placement.3. No back-lit keyboard, which are now standard in laptops in this price range4. The McAfee virus expired within few days even when it says it is 3 months free5. I purchased additional warranty, but HP just refused it without any reason
"
"Battery is draining very quickly even at hybernate mode.. processing is too slow..cannot run even 2 applications together smoothly.. looks like old laptop I bought with a new body only.. pathetic experience..

"Hopeless service by Amazon. They delivered laptop today. It is not loaded. I am not able to start it immediately. After following the voice commands I reached to a stage where it is asking for phone no to connect it to laptop. Even after putting this info not able to move ahead. This is completely disappointing. Now customer service and tech support team of Amazon is asking me to contact HP support team to get help. Pathetic service support.
"
"When i checked in HP support assistant it shows only 7 months warranty remaining,this is bad impact to me

"If u want a laptop within 45000 then this is the best one. Works very smoothly and it can support 2160p. Which is Awsm..you get 30 days free mcafee trial. Battery life is excellent. But the front facing cam is not so good. You get office 2016 installed.. MUST BUY THIS PRODUCT......

"Read the review if you are planning to buy this laptop.Pro's- Ships with Windows and MS office- Battery life is around 3-4 hours, which i think is just ok.- keyboard is very responsiveCon's- There are no LED lights in the laptop e.g. charging light- This laptop is very heavy, but that is accepted when i bought a 15"" laptop- for Core i5 and 8 gb ram, i feel the performance is slow- The screen color accuracy is faded.- Sound quality is below average- Mouse keys are very hard to pressI have a weird issue for which i am trying to get in HP support since last 2 days, but not able to get in touch with them..If you are looking for a laptop in the range of 40-45k, look for another brand laptop

"Experienced a very poor service from Amazon. The date of purchase is updated as the date of manufacturing in HP system which affects the duration of warranty. I got 10 months less waranty than the expected one. On contacting there is no support from either end i.e. from HP as well as Amazon in updation of their record even after providing necessary documents/evidence.
"
"Good laptop with amazing features at the price range. Rather slow at start up but makes up once it starts.  Good battery life and hp support. USB Jack's are cumbersome and one is rather slow. Sound quality is good. Overall nice product at this range..
"
"Very very slow. It is not even working fast with one browser. Even with only one Excel opened. Screen is not being displayed. I have restart manually with power button every 1 hr once. Worst product.dont buy. Cheaters.
"

"
"Screen is having lines. Want to return or get replacement.
"
"Laptop is very good with good performance and battery life. The negative sides are the weight and size of the laptop. I didn't realise the size of the laptop is very big and weight is heavy which makes it heavy to carry. The mouse pad in the laptop is not that user friendly. I would give  a 3.5 star rating.
"
"It's almost about a month now and I like the sleek design.. Charging is fast.. Battery backup is good ... Its bit slow ""sometimes"" in rare cases even when I use small software.... Boot up speed is very quick almost within 10sec... Overall I like this laptop
"
"IT HAS BEEN ADVISED AT AMAZON THAT THERE IS 1 YEAR MANUFACTURER WARRANTY. BUT WHEN I CHECK ON HP SITE. THE PRODUCT WAS ALREADY ACTIVE AND ONLY 5 MONTHS WARRANTY LEFT. 7 MONTHS WARRANTY LOSS. AND NO TAKER OF IT. THE WARRANTY SHOULD START FROM THE DATE OF INVOICE OF PURCHASE BY THE CONSUMER NOT BY RETAILER, WHICH IS IN THIS CASE.
"

"NOTE :@ Its Available on other Online stores as well, so check before you purchase.@ This model don't have Touchscreen, so note that.For using this device for couple of weeks, following are the observations from Normal User point of view.First I am mentioning the Specs and then I will explain the User Experience.Following are the Specifications :------------------------------------------# Intel® Core™ i3-7020U processor# 1 TB storage, 4GB DDR-4 RAM# Integrated Intel 620 Graphics# 14 inch HD Display with Resolution 1366*768.# 3-cell (41WHR) battery & Windows 10 OS.Following is the my user Experience :BUILD-QUALITY :------------------------# It has good build quality compared to price.# The top surface has matte finish and has good grip.# Speakers has good output.# It weighs around 1.5 KG, which is moderate weight considering the size.# Finally it looks good.DISPLAY :------------# HD LED screen with a resolution of 1366*768 performs great.# Colours are Punchy.# Contrast is well above average.# Display performs well upto my expectations.KEYBOARD & SPEAKERS :------------------------------------# Keyboard Doesn't have backlit.# Feedback from keyboard is good.# It Doesn't have a Numpad.# Placement pf speakers are good,# Has Enough sound output.# Performance is above average.BATTERY PERFORMANCE :--------------------------------------# Its average performing battery.# With full charge I used to clock above 3 hours of battery backup.# It charges under 3 hours.# Even with Medium Brightness and heavy Multitasking, I used to get above 2 hours of backup.# So overall battery backup is below average.SYSTEM PERFORMANCE :------------------------------------# I had NO problems while using this laptop for surfing and browsing internet.# Small and medium games also runs smoothly on it.# It Doesn't have fingerprint scanner.# Has 1x USB 2 and 2x USB 3 ports which are handy combination.# So to conclude its Average laptop.VERDICT :-------------Its a good device if the price would have being around 25k. UPS of this device is 7th gen processor, decent Storage and HP brand reliability. But apart from that there's hardly anything to attract. It lacks fingerprint sensor, Backlit keyboard, decent battery backup, better graphics and better display resolution. If there's a deal and if its available around 25k then go for it, else invest few thousand more and go for better device. For 30k its Not worth buying.
"
"Honest Review after using 3 months.I am Digital Marketer by profession and I need machine which can easily handle my heavy excel file and data work. I found this laptop good but still it is not at my level. If only accessing file, mails, PPT etc is concerned then it is the best laptop at this price range.I also have issue with the mouse pad, as the mouse which is coming up with this model is basic touchpad and not a multi touch pad.Rest everything is good.Thanks for reading! Hope this helps.Also, Get 10% Cashback by Ordering through vqr .in/13

"Best in looks, slim, light weight, display is awesome.....Performance as per specifications is good...It's a Beauty...Bought after so much research...Confused between Lenovo 330s and Dell latitude 14 inch series...It's much better than that....Would recommend this..

"Overall pretty good package....pros:Light weight..Decent battery backup...Good looking smoke grey colour..Good build quality...Cons:Inbuilt battery non removableGlossy display( mat display is good here it is glossy so reflection is there)Display quality is not uptomarkSound quality is averageSystem is little laggy... Not that much

"Nice product for this range.This lappy is really awesome if u buy around 26K. I bought it in 22990₹.Actual price was : 25990₹Instant discount applied from SBI card : 2000₹Received 1000₹ in Amazon Pay Balance : 1000₹Now Final price is 22990₹ (Great deal)
"
"I bought this laptop a month back during Amazon great indian festival. Been using it since then.The product is light weight, Sound is good, battery backup is good. But the important of all , the performance is horrible.I've exchanged my 5 year old HP laptop with 3rd gen i5 processor. This has a  7th gen i3 processor & still it's not even half good as my old one.The system lags , ALWAYS.Takes a lot of time to process any operations.I made a fresh install of windows 10 by created a recovery media & it's a bit better than how it used to be.I realized this is a faulty product but i was late by that time. the last date for return has already completed 2 days before that. So now i'm stuck with this super slow laptop, No where to go..and the worst thing.. RAM has only 1 slot with 4Gb, can't upgrade.
"
"Please DO NOT buy UP product as I am stuck and wasted around 30K.System hangs every second and no support.
"
"Purchased this Lappy for my Wife at the Amazon Sale for 23k after applying all discounts. I would say it is pretty good for the price. Looks sleek and slim, is light to carry around, screen display and sound is also good. Battery Life is pretty good at around 6+ Hrs. There is no fast charging though. As stated by others, performance is a slight issue. It is not fast or snappy and can take few seconds to launch apps. To get around it, i have added 4 GB Crucial 2400 RAM in Dual Channel and increased it to 8 GB. Though it is a challenge to remove the Back Cover to insert the RAM. HP has not made it end user friendly. Now, it responds better than before. Please do consider upgrading RAM to get around the slowness issue. Overall, it is a good laptop for doing basic tasks and light office work.
"
"Overall it's a nice package provided if you get it under 28k or 29kSound quality is awesome , being a win10 os on 4gb ram lags sometime but that is manageable , looks good ,battery life is acceptable , a complete value for money buy given in this range .Competition is fierce in this range so choose according to your requirements mine was portability and in this area it aces given its dynamics and above all THANK U HP & AMAZON
"
"This laptop has 7th generation i3 processor with 4gb ram and 1tb HDD, still from the first usage only I found that this laptop is 20 times slower than my 5 year old Pentium Lenovo laptop.Once you make the payment your payments also gets strucked with Amazon and also the policy is not at all customer friendly, they will not initiate refunds so that you can buy a new and different model if u want, you will have to settle down with the same model. I will be getting that same model again today, hope my 31000/- bucks does not go in drain as Amazon has confirmed that the 2nd product but same model will be working great. They said they will ensure this. I hope I don't have to go through the same pain and agony again.
"
"I bought the brand new laptopn but when it came it was  locked by user and i found that the laptop was used by someone... amazon technician also visited and approved the same but nothing happened after that as well. What should I do now?
"
"Pathetic, as expected online not trustworthy
"
"I bought this laptop about 2 weeks back and used it twice yet. The speed is pathetic, I am not sure if this is an original HP product. Unfortunately the last date of return was yesterday, so not even able to return it now.
"
"This laptop is good for office work only. Not recommended for performing heavy work like playing games and video editing work.
"
"Beautiful design and very lightweight. Comes with Core i3 and good for basic usage
"
"Combination does not work 4Gb Ram  is pretty slow .I  increased the Ram to 8 GB. Now is bit fine ,had place laptop decal / sticker  coz it looks dull .. well for me I am happy with my purchase depends on your requirement .. Just increase your Ram max 2500/3000 with service charge will do your college or office stuff be smart and wise ..
"
"The product is one of the worst functioning laptop. The product just hanging and i3 processors performance is pathetic and cant run basic functions. Clearly a specification created by HP to be sold thru amazon so that the buyers are stuck with the maze of Amazon support and question and answers. We are sitting on 2 laptops that have been nonfunctional for more than a month. We tried return policy and now been told this cannot happen with amazon for these products. so clearly a con job by both amazon and HP as joint party.
"
"Laptop looks very compact and impressive(Build Quality). Performance is average, can’t complain as the ram is only 4GB. By default the colors in display looked washed out and dull, however you can make it vibrant by increasing the saturation levels (to 30) in intel HD graphic settings after which display looks amazing and vivid.All in all a great buy at the given price point. Got it for 27500
"
"Very bad product. After 2 weeks it started giving  display problem. Speed is super slow.  Heating issues.  One cant tolerate its speed of operating. Can not do anything on it  within 2 months  repaired it almost 3 4 times.  Worst part is problem is still not solved.  No one ready to take responsibility.  Please do not buy.  Waste of money and after that waste of energy to call them again n again.
"
"Fast delivery and the item is superb and genuine.
"
"As a budget laptop it does the absolute bare minimum.Pros:Light enough to carry around.Decent battery life (3-4 hrs with normal usage)1TB HDD allows for lots of storageCons:Very slow in booting (~3 mins to welcome screen) in spite of having Win 10.Very slow in running apps. Office applications take almost 20 secs to initialize fully.Reflective screen. Hard to see with light source behind you. Gets dirty easilyBelow average sound quality.Overpriced. Belongs in the 20k range
"
"Worst product ..Never buy it...Looks like a fake product. And hp support is extremely poor. They never help.See the screen. Hardly been a month of buying and laptop throwing tantrums.Regretting my decision very badly.
"
"Light weight is a definite plus.However, performance is very slow. I had to put an  extra 4 GB RAM & a 250 GB SSD to make it bearable.
"
"Everything is good about this laptop. Just one it is very slow. Although u can fix it by uninstalling the software on start up. Also I have purchased it on Amazon in great price 15,500 including exchange and cashback during great Indian festival. Also you gotta great battery life lasts for 7 hours easily.Also it has fast charger about 90 percent in 1.5 hours.
"
"Ordered this product twice! Received faulty devices once, got it replaced. Ordered for the second time, and product stopped working after the return date had passed. Stuck with it now!
"
"Sleek, slim and light weight laptop. A great deal.if you are looking for a laptop that can be carried around with ease. However, the performance is abysmal. But you can get rid of the problem by upgrading the RAM to atleast 8 GB ( expandable upto 16GB as per spec). Furthermore, you could add an SSD to improve the boot speed. I purchased this machine for running MATLAB, but struggled with the default 4 GB RAM. Added another 4GB ( Crucial) and now it works fine. Next plan is to add an SSD.
"
"This is very low quality assemble. After 3 months ot started malfunctioning. I had to completely wipe out and reinstall the complete OS once. Still it is not in good condition. Too slow. Avoid buying with such low RAM which is mostly not compatible with windows 10. I would not recommend to buy this product unless it is for a student.
"
"The laptop display was corrupted within 2 days of usage. Apparently one of the rubbers in a corner was missing right from the time at was delivered. HP engineer noted this after inspection. Despite my best efforts to convince them that the laptop display I wasn't at fault, HP squarely put the blame upon me. It was such a sick and bad experience dealing with HP and their local service partner  TVS electronics in Gurgaon. The folks there never answer your calls and close cases without giving a ear to what the customer is saying. I have dealt with Dell service (for a laptop purchased again on Amazon) and their service is far far better and professional.
"
"The laptop takes 2 minutes to boot up. If i want to run a program like chrome or even open a folder, the laptop takes ages to execute that command. Some software issue so i asked amazon for help. the technician comes over and takes a look at the laptop for 5 minutes and says its a software issue so they can't help. Approached hp customer care. They said its because the ram needs to be upgraded. Why would i need to upgrade the ram in a new laptop without any programs installed? The laptop has been lying like this since the past 6-7 months. Nobody can use it at the risk of going into depression.
"
"I suggest to spend some more funds and buy laptop with better processor
"
"Chose this one for my sister. My first impression after opening the box was, how tiny and light weight this laptop is. Easy to hold and very convenient to carry.Talking about battert life, it's decent. I would say it would give you juice for around 3 to 4 hours( normal usage excluding games).Screen quality is also decent but not as immersive as those in higher end ones( don't expect great camera quality as it's below average)I would say after using the laptop and hearing no issues from my sister till now 😜I think this laptop is value for money laptop(NO EMI option is great /some bank discounts).I would definitely recommend this one who are looking for a decent looking and fast laptop. You can also add ssd card to fasten its processing and booting speed.
"
"The laptop received was faulty, I am following up like a crazy.
"
"The laptop is quite slow. It is however quite light and can be easily carried. I feel that my earlier 8 year old laptop was better built.My review after 5 months....Useless laptop. Freezes frequently.  Very, very slow. Please dear Amazonians don't buy ! I am now using my old laptop. Sad, money down the drain.Long term review.....I am giving a Tip to speed it up....DISABLE WINDOWS AUTOMATIC UPDATES.  INSTALL AN ANTI VIRUS. THE LAPTOP WORKS FINE NOW!
"
"Slim and light. Looks very professional... little bit slow processing.. Average Camera.. Nice sounds quality..Very slow and poor processing .Plz Don't buy it...
"
"Dead after 2 Days, very disappointed.
"
"Bought this last week. The only work I have is working on word documents and browsing. Even then, this laptop is sluggish at best. Windows 10 is not supported by a mere 4 GB RAM. So unless there is an option to enhance the RAM, this laptop is not worth it. As we say in hindi, 'Kaam Chalau'. I would rather spend few thounds extra and buy a better version.Other features like battery and screen quality are good. The track pad is pretty tardy. Unworkable perhaps.
"
"The product came i a good condition and on time. Gifted this to my father. The laptop is very lightweight and portable. The screen size is perfet for my dad. Battery life is decent and it performs the tasks of browsing and running some applications simultaneously quite decently. It's perfect for my dad's usage. Power users might want to see somewhere else. Windows 10 experience is good. My dad is happy, so I am happy.
"
"Best Laptop for light usage(Students), Not recommend for heavy gaming or Photoshops,firstly i got a faulty laptop (Fan not working),exchnged and got a New One..Processor - GoodSpeed - Not that Great, But It works better with Windows 8 and it feels quite lag in W10Ventilation - Fan vent. Is provided Below the Laptop (Very Bad)Price Point is Good
"
"Using this laptop from last 10 months,Screen quality is very worst. Color calibration is very disturbed,And very poor built quality.Internal locks get detached, when try to open lid keybord and keybord cover comes out.Registered a call for support on 24 of sept and today 10 oct. Still complain  not resolved by HP.
"
"Light weight Laptop comes with Windows 10 Home OS. 1TB HDD is decent storage. 4GB DDR 4 memory gives the smooth operation. Longer Battery life - claims for 7 hours but last for more than 5 hours. Battery seems to be built- in. Don;t know how to get a replacement after expired. Need to take it to the service center, you cannot change it yourself. This is the only drawback. Overall I am Satisfied with this Laptop. Recommended.
"
"Remember, No MS- office preinstalled.Upgraded the RAM to 8GB, still lagard.Suggest to go for i5 if planning to use for official work
"
"Overall I would say great deal at this price pointI bought it at 25990 during great India festival saleThis is awesome and good for office worksIt justifies my needsI am not a game freak so I bought itIt carers me in all my office and education related work
"
"Product rating 3.5.Ok, so I am writing this review after using this product for over a month.There are lot of reviews about this product on the web and even on Amazon, so there is a high possibility of creating a lot of confusion.Note below points and if you are ok, then buy this product without any second thought:1. Win 10 64 bit+ 4 gb Ram + i3 7th Generation, all this together won't provide you very great performance in any brand.2. Still, you will get a decent performance for browsing, using any softwares or even playing mid range games.3.If you go on to upgrade the Ram, things will work pretty well.4. HP comes with lot of preloaded softwares that will create a lag for the initial experience of around 15 mins for using the laptop. But after that everything works fine.5. It is pretty light weight and well built which enables it to carry around with ease.
"
"We bought this for our office use. The general usage is only in excel, word and mails. Even for this activity, the system is dead slow. It switches off quite often. We did not expect this quality from reputed manufacturer like HP.  We are disappointed.After submitting this response on 3rd July, not a single response from HP. This shows their careless attitude for defective model. I used to always buy HP product for personal use and official use. This attitude will change my mind and will not take HP at face value. Again disappointed.
"
"I feel sorry for Amazon for not ensuring the right product! Actually what I received might be a duplicate...The pre installed OS not working properly. I uninstalled it. Also, it doesn't has a barcode and nothing else and it made be high subspecies about its genuiness!Trust me 100% and avoid to buying it!
"
"Sir/ Mam,This for your kind information and necessary action that my laptop is still not functioning properly ,As few days back you people made second ID of mine but still same problem,Then I called back many times to call centre but nobody picked my call then I wentto service station of Ahmedabad , they guided me that I need to call on customer care and ask for pendriveand take your data in that pendrive and reinstall data again then I did same but still same problem.Now m unable to understand what to do to replace this laptop as my job work is in halt and I am loosing 5000rs per daydue to this laptop inefficiency , pls suggest who will bear this loss??Also i don’t want this laptop now , pls take it back from me as I need to purchase some other laptop and I dont have amount to purchase laptop again.Kindly expedite else I will go in court for the solution as my life is disturbed due to this non-sense product .Regards,Manish Sharma

"Not at all meeting expectations, I still have my 5-year old Lenovo which performs better than this one... It keeps getting frozen at everything... has some major issues, especially for a brand new laptop, that too for a brand like HP & I haven't even installed anything big or major to slow it down soo much & it's only a few months old... I'm searching for my warranty information to return or get it replaced... I'm regretting choosing this over Lenovo bcuz I was getting a good deal, or so I thought...

"ThIs laptop is bogus. Don't be fooled by the low price and loaded windows. The laptop though lightweight is highly bloated with pre built software's and the moment you switch on you will see the disk space is 100% consumed and 80%memory is consumed.. I bought this laptop one week  to install some bi tools and boy I am super disappointed..
"

"The name and quality of HP, 1 TB HDD, 4 gb RAM, latest 9th generation A9-9125 processor, 5 hrs. battery back up, fast speed (2.30 GHz of 9th gen. processor i.e. of today  is equal to 3.5 GHz of the competition). Very good for multi-tasking etc. At the same time do not make the mistake of thinking it has similar capabilities to that of gaming laptops. For below 21K this is best and cheapest laptop you can buy.

This wasn't all expected.Still struggling for the actual laptop I paid for.

"Researched a lot to get a laptop for almost 15 days and didn't want to buy those gigantic gaming lappys but still wanna game some. Came across this beauty as it was a notebook with great and power-packed specs. HP at it's back, it got a thumbs up from me.So using it for three days I have my impressions as below.Build Quality :- Absolutely excellent. Though it is made up of plastic, great finish and not prone to fingerprints.Display :- A FULL HD 1920×1080 panel makes it worth to consume media and other stuff. I loved the display but viewing angle are okaish.Battery :- This is where the device shines. With normal usage it is giving a usage time of 6-7 hrs or more but while gaming it's reduced to half due to the heavy NVIDIA GTX 1050 operations.Keyboard :- Much tactile and solid buttons with brilliant backlit coloured in green. Mouse Pad is average due to non-seperated buttons.Finally, it's a great and ideal deal for a student or other works. Recommended to buy.

"Belive me this laptop is a true beast with gtx1050, it gives resonable fps on most AAA games. This laptop gives the best B&O sound experience, sometimes it is even loud as jbl go, but all you need is perfect drivers for that and let the sound fly. The best thing is battery life, it once gave me 5 hrs with autoCAD, and 6 hrs of movie(vlc) time, but thats not it comes with some kind of boost chargin, which takes approx 50 mins to get fully charged from zero.Aesthetics are pretty neat. Acid Green color stands bold and beatiful not like those cheap red. Laptop body is another plus point, its clean and bold with a small touch hp logo it makes it elite.About basic features:It really has a nice keyboard one of its class I really it. Touch pad is the one that dissapoints me, its not that bad buut in this price range and features they should have worked a little bit for that.The port select is just normal. You get 3 usb 3.0 with hdmi, ethernet port, hdmi, headphine jack. They should have atleat given a usb type C(but the charger recovers that thing).Now most imortant thing for quality screen lover:This screen is not that good according to price range, but what more did you expect. If you are taking it PS or premiere pro.... Then go for some other options, this is just bcoz of screen. Although its not that bad but yeah its not for artists. And by the way its just 60hz.Here are some of my fps counter for some of my games:Just cause 4(max): 30fpsShadow of tomb raider(high):37-45CSGO(high): 120'sCOD IW(HIGH): 55'sMortal Comat X(max): 60Batman Arkam Knight(max):30Far cry 5(max): 35-50 it did touch 60 in medium settingsNFS payback(max):30And more maintained the legacy

"I specifically bought this laptop for 1650 GTX, when I am playing Just Cause 3 it abruptly stopped and threw me this error (attached in pic) I restarted my laptop and still the same, as soon as the game starts its giving this error still not resolved, I first thought there might be an error with the specification, To my surprise the recommended specifications for Game are way to less than the laptop config.Worst service ever..... I am going to take a replacement. and check, if that doesn't work, will return the product.These are the specifications of the Game which I am playing(Just cause 3)Operating System: Vista SP2 / Windows 7.1 SP1 / Windows 8.1 (64-bit Operating System Required)CPU(Processor): Intel Core i7-3770, 3.4 GHz / AMD FX-8350, 4.0 GHzRAM(Memory): 8 GB RAMGPU(Graphics): NVIDIA GeForce GTX 780 (3GB) / AMD R9 290 (4GB)Storage: 54 GB available space

"i got a new laptop with damaged/faulty keyboard. I contacted to HP, but the service is worst. The HP didn't contact me for this issue even after 6 months of complaint.
"
"After operating this laptop for about a week I started getting battery charging issues. Being a hardware issue, it was not visible during the technical troubleshooting and my ticket was closed. Due to the battery issues my HDD crashed eventually and had to force Amazon to make my replacement request happen. during that time I was told my complaint would stay open till my issue is resolved. The same issue started with the replacement model and Amazon told me that my replacement window has well lapsed and can't give me a refund. I was under the impression that the complaint window has been closed as soon as I got the refund which was not the thing which I was told. I have spent 64000 on this laptop and still have to go the service center even though Amazon has sold me bad products both times and it's well within my rights to request a refund for the laptop.
"
"I'm complaining about the defective piece issue since 1st day of the delivery, but no action is taken yet. I haven't seen any return or replace order for this product on amazon app. The charger of the product stops charging everytime just after 15 minutes automatically while plug in and socket power is on. I have done all the troubleshoot action told by support team and updated all the drivers too! Please, understand my problem & place return order for this product as early as possible, as lot of my work is pending just because of this issue.
"
"The worst display ever. Wrong info on site, this laptop has no ips panel and color and contrast are evn worse than my 7k redmi phone. Pathetic
"
"The spec says it all. It's fast, powerful and it's bliss to work with. It is mesmarizing the way it handles the challenges I throw towards it. The thing which I personally feel that could be improved is the battery back up. Couple of more hours would have been better. I got 5 hours of back up with normal usage, if it would have been 7, that would be perfect and 16 gb ram too. Coz 40 Percent of RAM is already occupied on start up. So if you run anything like eclipse and multiple instances of chrome at the same time, the memory usage jumps to 60 - 65 percent.So I guess in the current world we live in, a laptop needs 16gb RAM, and 1TB SSD to cope up with our future requirements.But all in all, a great buy.P. S. It would have been even better with a wireless mouse and a laptop bag :P and a Ferrari if that's not too much to ask
"
"The laptop is powerful and fast but I bought this laptop because of Nvidia GTX 1650 4GB GPU. I am not able to run any game on this laptop, the game either freezes and crashes or I get the error DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED.I have tried upgrading/downgrading the graphic drivers, updating the BIOS, resetting the System, different games.Nothing seems to fix this.I want HP to help me with this so that I can write a positive review, I am stuck and feeling betrayed as this is a gaming laptop.
"
"Decent cpu and gpu. But falls short in screen. Not ips and colors look a bit dull. But overall good laptop. Csgo 220+fps, dota 2 100+. Thermals are good too.
"
"Overall the laptop is awsome. Played batman Arkham Knight in high settings, Witcher 3 in high settings, watch dogs 2 in high settings(lags a little bit sometimes, but totally playable) . The laptop is a little slow though due to the absence of a SSD but it's not too slow, it's descent . If you want to get 100 percent performance out of this laptop you should install an ssd and then this laptop will become a gaming beast.

"Before buying this laptop, I read all reviews. Lucky people got a good machine. Unlucky people got really bad ones. I got a VERY BAD ONE. I have never experienced such sorry performance from any laptop. I have owned a Thinkpad, a Samsung laptop, a Sony Vaio and the last was an Asus. Im really sorry to say that this 9th gen core i5 with 8GB DDR4 RAM is PATHETIC!1. Fan is running non stop2. It is so SLOW, you cannot do anything in it3. Have to click more than 2 or 3 times on any icon, window, etc.4. Start up takes 5 mins minimum5. I have tried Hitman Absolution, COD BO2, Far Cry 3 and 4, COD Ghosts. NOTHING works!! Nothing!!6. I am planning to buy Traktor full version. Thats y i bought this PC. But now I think it cannot run Traktor. With this kind of sorry performance.7. Connection to TV is a big headache. Sometimes display lag, other times no sound output from external speaker connected to TV. Various problems.8. WIFI is poor. USB connection takes ages!!9. I have stopped using. I have returned to my old Lenovo desktop with i3 and 2 GB RAM. Much faster10. Amazon has promised replacement, so I will wait.My advice to HP! Please dont sell such kinds of devices. HP is a renowned brand. This kind of un tested and below par performance will not be accepted. I will never again buy any HP product. Last but not least, if this laptop is not replaced with a WORKING one, I will donate it to an HP showroom and spread the good news in social media. So that people dont lose 58k on this piece of crap.

"Do not buy worst product by hp
"
"Pros:1.There is no flaws on windows booting with Solid state disk 512GB.2.Gaming optimization is well done.3.KeyBoard backlit keys and volume was perfect and audible.Cons:1.Storage is small while living in this generation.
"
"Overall a good package deal in a decent price range .Performance is great due to gpu and 9th gen i5 and ssd. The display was average to me and not a problem while gaming ,the colors were good.Thermals were also good and it has a very good battery life.You can do any stuff with this beast whether gaming, coding,editing,etc.
"
"Pathetic display, it's display is too bull and side angle viewing is pathetic.
"
"Amazing budget performance. Hp has done great job in gpu cooling department overall a great laptop for daily usage and high to very high gameplay experience.
"
"I bought two machines of HP in the month of July and July respectively. One started giving problems after a month and the second one started giving problems after 20 days. We have been calling their customer care for last 20 days but their technical support is simply horrible. I have wasted my 1,00,000 by keeping my faith in the brand HP. We have the recorded conversation with their technical support that i am going to put on social media.A big NO to their product. Please, guys, be aware of brand HP>

"Terrible hangs all the time - I wont recommend this to an enemy

"Product was delivered on time. This laptop with i7 8th Gen at its heart is super fast compared to my old i5. Thanks,  as I had ordered for the same config on d*l*s**** for 92k. They cancelled it and kept the money with themselves for 1 month . In a way it was a boon in disguise.
"
"This is a must buy laptop in this price range, It can handle multiple tasks easily. A very good laptop with good features, Hope it lasts long
"
"This laptop is an amazing buy and one of the best if not the best in the price rangeA 1050Ti with an SSD FOR 65000/-!!!!And if u have a very crappy laptop like me you can get an extra discount via exchangeGreat delivery - delivered in 2 daysPerfect conditionThe laptop is very fast and snappyBoots up in 10-15 secs1050Ti can play any game you want at medium to high settings at 1080p 60fpsThe only complaint is the screen, its not great but its not bad either for its priceOverall great for gamingOkay battery life (good for a gaming laptop though)And love the build quality and designHave been using it for over a week now, and loving it with all my heart
"
"I purchased this premium laptop from @HP assuming that the customer support or post-sales service would be good. But firstly, the motherboard crashed within 6 months of purchase and the laptop conked off for no reason. Later, on complaining to HP the case was handed over to a local third-party service center that just keeps postponing and postponing. It has been over 10 days since my laptop stopped working and each time they find some new reason to postpone.If I call HP, they blame it on the service center and say that they can't do anything about it. If I call the service center no-one picks up. HP expects me to follow-up with the service center on a daily basis even though I bought this laptop from HP - not from service center!If you are willing to run around between the service center and HP while your business suffers (even during warranty period), only then buy HP. I honestly don't know if Dell or other brands are better, but all that I know is that I am NEVER buying HP again.Trust me guys, it's not worth spending more than 80K on a laptop that crashes within 6 months... that too from a company that doesn't believe in customer support. I am seriously disappointed in this product and in HP.

"Good choice for the below 70k price range512gb ssd gets you a good start for gamingBoot time is Atmost 5 sec.Games run well, just need to optimize the Nvidia game experience accordinglyYou can control the heat but reducing from the optimal level in the game experience softwareBattery lasts for about 4-5 hours on normal usageThat is excel report's, YouTube, movies, songs etcCombinedThe charger is small unlike the behemoth brick charger we getWebcam is also okay, not much to talk about.Display though is sub par, not that bad butIt is not quite goodSound is also subpar, but you can adjustDefinately not a deal breakerThe design is sleek and it weighs around 2.3kgCan carry it with out much effort. McAfee antivirus is for 1month only, if it matters to you people.Warranty is 1year for the product, contact the service centre to extend it.Last but not the leastA good choice for midrange gamingPUBG was running on ultra with no problem, in case you want a benchmark reference with no stats.
"
"It's  a very good laptop for gaming purposes and for students like me who are doing B.tech cause it's having all the latest thing excluding the i7 processor .But it's having a dedicated SSD m.2 slot which can make your laptop worth buying  cause it increases the speed
"
"Nice product by hp but should be include SSD which is not there so booting time is quite high but no worries.Value for money is good , sound quality is awesome, battery life is average but good for gaming laptop.
"
"Do not buy this.
"
"I bought the 15.6 inch, FHD, Core i7, 9th Gen, 4gb graphics, 8gb RAM,  512gb SSD model.Startup is quick.  Battery lasts long. The laptop is zippy, silent and cool.  Full marks in this department.  Green backlit keyboard gives an interesting look.The screen is full HD, crisp, clear but viewing angle is a little disappointing.  You will have to adjust the tilt as per sitting height posture often.MS Office is trial version.  You’ll have to buy a subscription for regular use.  As is always the case with HP, lot of bloatware, which I uninstalled.It’s not been used for gaming yet.  I essentially bought it for the processor.  This was probably the cheapest i7 - 9th Gen - SSD combination on offer, amongst the three top selling laptop brands (Lenovo, HP, Dell) during the Amazon sale.I’ll later update with further details after a month of usage.Bottom Line:-Product is recommended for purchase.
"
"I was skeptical at first as the official HP website had no info about this 9th gen (i5-9300H) equipped variant. But they day it got delivered HP updated its website and did add support and driver download links for the 9th gen variant on its website(EDIT- they fixed it)BEWARE THOUGH, SOMEONE ON AMAZON MESSED UP BIG TIME.The option where you can select the variant, Amazon has listed it as 8th gen variant and the 8th as 9th gen Variant.And I had accidentally bought(and paid for) the 8th gen, I cancelled it and then I bought 9th gen after a day when they refunded the money back.I am actually downloading the latest Windows 10 Pro (*unactivated) for this as I don't care about having legit window. As a crack can officialize both Office And Windows for me.And I also removed the Intel and Nvidia sticker on front and repasted on the back just for the sake of clear uninterrupted ergonomicsI also suggest buying the Redhead EMERA something mouse to match the matte black finish of the laptopI couldn't post the specs from Windows coz just now I formatted it but did capture a picture from BIOSLike to help others and my name isn't this it's just that my mom ordered this from her Amazon account for insurance purpose --\\(°_°)//--I was thinking of buying this(when they had only 8th gen variant) or ASUS FX-705DY (best laptop with AMD processer and AMD dedicated graphics card and the best -17 inch screen). Had to settle for this becoz of family stuff and their trust on Intel and HP and Nvidia (mostly my brother's). They don't trust Asus or AMD Processor and graphics combo even though it has higher base clock better cooling and better display.Nonetheless they launched the 9th gen variant on the day I had to buy it so that it arrives just before I leave for college. And then this was a steal. I might have been the first to buy the 9th gen variant on Amazon hadn't it for the sick messed up mistake Amazon did that on variant selecting optionThe only bad thing about this laptop is the shitty screen they have on.Its got worst viewing angles they ever made.like 90 degrees in total (45 from Normal)And I won't suggest this laptop for casual family or office use. It is strictly for heavy personal use be it gaming or editing.
"
"Build quality is nice..looks are classic.Ran few games over here..such as battlefield 5, devilmaycry5,tekken7,fifa18...as so reachable by me.DMC5,tekken5,fifa18 ran on ultra with minor lags next to no i would say, battlefield suffered a little but reducing the resolution will do the work..Plug into charging for playing heavy games for smooth performance...sound is nice..display os decent.
"
"Speakers are great, nice backlight and easy hotkeys. No issues in running, only problems are the size of the trackpad and battery device driver. The trackpad could have easily been an inch longer, there's enough space. Other problem is that the battery stops charging sometimes between 70 and 80 percent. So far, starting the device manager and plugging it again seems to fix the issue.Edit: The battery issue was fixed by a Windows update, laptop works perfectly, updating rating to five stars.
"
"The laptop is very slow from the 1st day. Has a lot of time lag. Even though it has a fast processor, it takes quite some time for the laptop to switch on and is also very slow while launching different softwares.
"
"It's very light weight, doesn't heat much. Boot time is very fast due to SSD . Got it for almost 63k in prime deal. Feel satisfied ! The only thing I wished is more space, 512 Gb is a bit less, which I'll have to upgrade with time.
"
"Using the laptop for around 2-4 days,Not played games on it yet, but used it for whole day on those 2-4 days,1.Good battery life for daily uses, around 8hr...Note- not tested with games.CHARGING IS ALSO FAST2.Display is ok...!3. Performance- here it is just excellent.Compare to ""U""segment i5 8th gen laptop, it is a Gr8 bye..........!specifically comparing i5-8265U &i5-8250U.This laptop will give you good  enough performance (comparable to 8th gen i7 ""U""segment) for your daily needs as well as fulfilling your gaming requirements. Performance is some how desktop level, which is realy good.There are other HP laptop with 9th gen processor, go for them if price is not your concern, Just to have latest gen processor is always advisable.Note -there is not much difference in 8th gen i5-8300H and 9th gen i5-9300H,if you want silky smooth performance from your laptop go for this one even if you are not a gamer.For those who are Interested in Actual specificationsDisplay Full HD 1080P TN ( NOT a IPS PANEL)PROCESSOR- 8TH GEN I5-8300H(2.4Ghz to 4 Ghz)RAM-2400MHz 8GBSTORAGE-128SSD+1TB HDDGRAPHICS CARD-NVIDIA-GTX 1050Ti 4GB( its not GTX1050)Speakers-B&oBACKLIT KEYBOARD ACID GREEN COLOURInput1 RJ452USB 3.01 USB 2.01 HDMI1 SD CARD READER SLOT1 MIC+HEADPHONES COMBO JACKLICENSE WINDOWS 10WISH YOU LUCK FOR Gr8 DEALS ON YOUR PURCHASE 😊👍

"Do yourself a favor and buy some other laptop.Read all the reviews and please concentrate on the screen issue. It is really bad;viewing angle is terrible for a laptop at this price. I made the mistake to overlook the comments about the screen. There's also keyboard issue, Keys are loose,boot time is considerable , GTX 1050 is OK.
"
"It got really powerful processor but  the laptop would have excelled in price range if it would have gtx 1660 or 1650 graphics card... 1050 is pretty old graphics card
"
"The laptop is good and the best part is the configuration of the laptop. The gaming is really smooth. I normally use this laptop for high-end number crunching in terms of data analysis for stock market. Note it has windows 10 home edition.The laptop is heavy and batter lasts only 1hr when on gaming rest it would last for alteast 2 hrs on other stuff. I plan to get the battery check in warranty soon.Very important ======== Read the Manual after purchase.
"
"To be true the specs are awesome with gtx 1650 better than gtx 1050 ti when paired with i5 9th gen..and 512 GB ssd is a bonus! windows boots in less than 5 seconds! Good for everyone except the ones looking for a good display...Ps:it has a tn display with 60hz refresh rate...display is bright but viewing angles are not so good and comfortable!
"
"Not sure if it is my bad luck or not, this is a fully worthless product even after the replacement.Most affecting is its sound.I contacted HP support N they are unwilling to provide any visit or support on this.Existing clients complained with whatever app is used for communication (Hangout, Skype, Meeting).And today we loss one new client for this communication issue.I had Pavilion dv6 so good that second time I went for HP but its a curse in myself.Not sure how to express myself!
"
"Everything good but brightness and battery life could have been more, but overall a good laptop. Handles heavy games quite well and one can enjoy long hours of gaming sessions without worrying about heating issue. If you do not want those typical heavy gaming laptops with unorthodox designs, but still want to do some gaming, go for this.
"
"This is the 3 rd day with this laptop, Till now the impression is good,  Built quality feels premium even though it is made up of plastic.I don't know about heavy gaming like AAA games coz I don't have one till now.But I played pubg,  it runs on medium settings.And I also played Asphalt 9, it runs good, graphics is nice.Display is not so great at this price point, viewing angles are not good.Battery is awesome, It gave me 7 hours backup for movies, in medium brightness.
"
"Very Dull display... Feels very cheap. I am disappointed after buying this.
"
"The product is absolutely fantastic. The performance is really excellent. The lap functions at very high speed. Less booting time. Optimised cooling system. Less weight. And high graphic resolution
"
"I bought hp pavilion 15 bc 513tx model. I am writing this review after using it for a month.First impression of laptop was perfect.1.Starting time or boot time is just 6 to 8 second which is really amazing!2. Display is very nice with bright colours.3. Speed of laptop is nice.4. i5 9th gen prosser get all task smoothly and fast.5. Nvdia graphics 1650 are very good and in  high graphics setting it works fluent6. Cooling system is very nice with centre cooling, cooling system works in effective manner if you use it on table or horizontal surface then it doesn't heat any other part.Fans don't make much noise.7. Sound are also nice.8. Good standard and premium look makes it different from other gaming laptop9. Good for high graphics software.10. 512 gb ssd is totally awesome every thing you run will be 10 times faster, similar kind of speed like i7 9th gen in its hdd.  Very nice laptop.Must buy and try 512 gb ssd because that makes it perfect!!
"
"Super fast, thanks to the SSD , acid green keyboard is flawless , screen is a bit full but if you know how to change Intel graphics settings it will do the work , b & o help to deliver high quality sound , battery backup is also good , worth buying if available under 57k.
"
"I got this laptop at 54k on Amazon prime sale which is a great deal.I'm satisfied with the overall specs of the laptop but two things I think could have been better would be it's trackpad which is really average with mat finish and it's LCD screen.Secondly, the delivery which is really disappointing. If one is paying for amazon prime he/she could be getting the delivery with in two - three days. It took them literally 2 weeks almost.Thirdly, Not sure I should be expecting this. I only have an experience buying the laptop from the store and this is first time I bought it online. I was really expecting a Hp bag or atleast a laptop cover to protect my laptop incase.Now, when I called amazon cs for the same they advised that it depends from seller to seller. So if you're planning to buying the laptop choose your seller wisely.Apart from that I just wanted to use this laptop atleast for a week or two before giving out a review.It's a Fantastic machine. I bought this primarily for video editing, gaming and my other day to day tasks. Everything runs so smooth on this till now.
"
"I was so excited for this product being a graphic designer. Reading all the specifications on Amazon and the HP official site, I was believed that this is the best laptop I can get in my range. As soon as I got the product I KNEW I MADE THE WRONG CHOICE!The specifications are okay but the screen is horrible. The colors are so faded that any editing you do it will give results far different. I don't even know how HP thought that this pathetic display will be enough for gamers. I regret buying this and honestly it was a waste of my money. I even put in an SSD for the speed but the display is so bad that it is unbearable to view anything. Everything looks dull. I am really disappointment in HP.I REQUEST EVERYONE TO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! THERE ARE MANY OTHER GAMING LAPTOPS IN THIS PRICE RANGE THAT HAS MUCH BETTER DISPLAY QUALITY.
"
"Boot speed varies from 5sec to 10sec. SSD does its job perfectly. Just played pubg at HD and high frame rate and it's buttery smooth. Best for gaming in this range. Battery life is a major plus. Buffered youtube video continuously for 2 and half hour and battery drained from 90 to 71%. I liked and loved almost everything except the display. It's not that it is bad, but you will see the difference once you play any video. Still value for money if you get it under 60k. will update the review after using someday.(updated)
"
"Performance is not as good as the specifications suggest (hangs a little sometimes). Battery life is good. Maybe the best in this price range.
"
"I'm using this laptop since 4 month, I feel it works very smoothly and game play is amazing that I never felt before. When I use it for my daily simple work I really amazed to see that it's battery life is amazing it works upto 8hours but when I use it for heavy works like playing a heavy game it works upto 4 to 5 hours. I felt it's viewing angle might not be perfect but still it's a best product I'm happy with it. If you are searching a best gaming laptop then I hope you should go for this product.
"
"This laptop is excellent for coding ,animation and gaming.If you want a fast bootup then u better go for a ssd and install it coz it has a separate port for thatWindows was updated to the 1809 edition with march 2019 security patchJust download nvidia geforce experience from their site for better experienceBattery charges very quickly and u get up to 2.5-3.5 hrs of watching videos and surfing the internet at 70% brightnessThe speakers are gudOnly problem I have is with the display if i was put at gun point to point out a problem in this laptopOverall You should either go for this or for rog strix new 9th gen series
"
"The most I liked is gaming performance and keyboard backlight. ...the charging is quite good......just one problem is that if u play without charger it comes to 0% within 1 or 1 and half hour......but if u want to do only gaming it's best to do with charger.........best product for gaming and performance..... no heating issues
"
"Bought this laptop on 20th July 2019 at 2:30pm around. Started only twice. Today when I started it the device is dead. Poor products from Amazon. Never expected of such product.
"
"The product proved to be more than good.This comes with a 8gb RAM,1 tb HDD(5400RPM),GTX 1050 and I5 9th gen.The 1st con about is that HP is not offering the SSD which almost every laptops at this price range is offering along with the HDD.Please dont ask how good is the battery because if you are using for gaming you cant play without plugging in your charger as the battery would drain pretty fast.And thus it gets heated up a bit!This is where i feel the air vents should have been placed on the sides and not at the bottom!Overall the product is nice! if you are looking for a gaming laptop  and also for using SOFTWARES like SOLIDWORKS,ANSYS i feel this is the one you should go for!Also they dont provide you with the bag!If you buy offline you would get a bag with this surely!
"
"Serious issue with this laptopEach game is crashing after few minutes of gameplay.The error message is direct 3d error device removed.This not for single game play it happens with every game .I have done everything from updating drivers ,updating windows to restoring windows to factory reset .Nothing seems to fix this error .The laptop using powerful gtx 1650 and i7 9th geneation still this issue.I feel betrayed.
"
"Not best....but A very good Gaming laptop.its5400rpm not 7200.128gb ssd.As per budget of around 75k a satisfactory one.i got it in 75000-2000(instant disc.)-1000(got as Amazon pay)-5500(10 per cashback)=66500
"
"I loved the looks of it, the design, the acid green backlit keyboard, slim andddd the sound of it is so good but i was expecting a great lit up display as i am a content creator. Every time i edit a picture or video i don't find it similar to the colors of my smartphone, colors are not as good as any of the smartphone. Didn't match my expectations.Even though it's a great piece.... Love it
"
"It is not a gaming laptop. it is just like a toy. Screen look like 10 year old nokia phone. Zero resolution, worst brightness..  Amazon is not accepting to return this item. By friends dont gent in to this trap. Get Asus or Acer laptop very cheap and good quality.

"Sound from speakers are noisy , i even suspect this to be a duplicate product
"
"Worst product ever 🖕🖕🖕🖕
"
"Laptop is good.Its gets full charge in 90-120 mins.Though there is little  heating problem and touchpad is not as expected.Hadn't run a game yet.Ssd memory provides good speed to the laptopOverall a good laptops under 60k .

"It's a good choice for me. It's fast & I like it. However mouse pad is not very comfortable to use. Need to click multiple times for right click..

"Very slow! I didn't expect this with 8 gb RAM! It takes too long to turn on and files open long after clicking icon and sometimes stops responding!
"
"First thing first - 1050ti and 128ssd for 65,000 is unbeatable. The laptop is simply superb in quality,speed and Amazon did an amazing job by delivering it on time
"
"Great product.Delivered on time. Fast booting.
"
"It is a third class product. you won't find this product in HP website. They have integrated old hardware with processor. Game with low configuration won't work. Will start heating after 10 minutes. game with requirement 650 graphic card will not work properly. Check HP official website. i bought i7 9th gen
"
"If you prefer performance over anything else for this price, then surely go for it. As of now, most of the games I have played have run smoothly without crashing. GPU is really good. But, I feel it lacks a bit in the user experience part. As expected, for this price you have to bear with certain trade offs.
"
"Very bad product.Has stopped working after three months and we are running from pillar to post to get it repaired.Also warranty of one year does not cover the whole product.Low quality chinese product.Dr. Alvin Daud502 , Tirath Bakshi ApartmentsNew Hyderabad , LucknowMob number 9260976445
"
"better to purchase this one.gaming vise and normal usage for good one.battery life 6 hours minimum.
"
"The laptop is slow on bootup but it's able to handle intense work without glitches. It's good for a amateur creative user in any multimedia purpose. As a gamer is below average performance but can handle stuff at medium graphic settings. I love this laptop for light weight.
"
"nice laptop worth every single penny. brightness is good overall performance is good but the packaging by amazon is not of good quality the product was just delivered in boxes without any protection that's the only thing which disappointed me besides that the product is really nice..
"
"It's such a slow laptop. It's slower than my previous i3 laptop. Very few games are able to run. The downloading speed is also very very slow. I recommend to buy a laptop from the store instead of online. Also it takes really a lot of time to start once I shut it down.
"
"Product is good aa far as gaming is concerned it works great with all aspects expcept one it takes too much time for booting and some processes takes more than one minute to complete (for e.g. on clicking right click after staring laptop takes 2 min to show menu)Battry life is good .
"
"Totally unsatisfied with the display. I bought it for 72900 during the sale. Display is worst  even my Redmi note 4 has too far better display than this laptop. Each colour seems to be fade away. It has no ips display and viewing angle is just ok.  I can't edit a single photo.
"
"The price to this product is a bit higher 66k
"
"most games like far cry 5 , far cry new dawn, Assassin's creed odyssey crashes here in this laptop, my suggestion is upgrade to 16 gb RAM to play this heavy games.

"Laptop is good. Chip is fast. Keyboard and buttons for TouchPad could have been better. Sometimes the buttons miss to register as being clicked, which takes some points away from the overall premium feel.

"Very Speedy. Screen bit of a let down. Everthing apart from that is great. Good Battery life, decent speakers, great performance .
"
"Good for gaming and programming alsoBut display lacks as it is a tft display which provide poor quality brightness also.Hard disk is also average as it provides 1tb space but its speed slower.I bought it for 64k worth the purchase.

"It is great to experience a Chromebook. This is faster than my Mac and Windows computers and very easy to use. Boots up quite fast. This should be good for most people for general use. This seems to be a well balanced Chromebook and is a good for its price. If someone wants a better quality screen, they can go for a higher end Chromebook. As a daily driver, this has become my first go to machine.  Good to see that finally HP is bringing Chromebooks to India at a reasonable price.
"
"Please don't buy this product. I received a faulty product. Its not turned on. I have charged this for 3 hrs but still its not working. I informed amazon call centre regarding this problem, but they are not ready to give replacement also.
"
"overall a good experience of my first Chromebook
"
"I've been using Chromebooks since they were launched and am completely invested into the Google ecology.The battery life is great, the screen is above average at this price point. Only quibble is the inability of the hinge to enable using it as a tablet. The sound from the speakers is just terrible too. The keyboard and touch screen are both quite responsive. It's a great road warrior - cheap and easy to lug around. If it lasts more than 2 years, that's just great.
"
"For my everyday purposes of browsing, shopping and social media, this Chromebook is perfect!! I never needed Windows and when I read about the Chromebook, I was hopeful that it is just what I needed...and it is! I'm happy with the screen/display, with the sound...everything! And it's fast too :) If you don't need all the extra bells and whistles that comes with Windows, then you will love the simplicity of the Chromebook.
"
"Very worst only for browsing if u want to purchase this you should go with mobile means mobile is better than chromebook
"
"Awesome
"
"A decent Chromebook by HP. White color looks awesome. My very first Chromebook and I am in love with it. Faster and secure than windows. Good for everyday tasks. No lag boosts faster.

"Hi, I have been using  HP 14Q CS0009TU laptop for a month now.Pros:1.5 Kg laptop - light in weight than any other brand in this price segment.Value for money - I purchased for Rs 24999/- (Dos OS) ; Windows OS model is around 29kCompact in size - The 14-inch screen is quite convenient to operate and carryMouse pad and keyboard is quite good. Suitable for rough use. The webcam is not of great quality but it fulfills its purpose.Battery life is pretty decent, it's last long for 5.5 hours. My usage is: I carry it to the office by train and work for 9 hours daily(suggested to work in Airconditioned environment for long hours usage).I have loaded Opensource Ubuntu (version -18.04)  as you can see in the images.Quick Charger -  It takes 45 min to charge the battery to 100 %, pretty fast.Speaker is of Average music quality, loudness is decent  (use good quality earphones to listen to nice music)4GB RAM is PerfectI am not a Gammer - I hope Intel Core i3 7th Gen processor with 4 GB ram is sufficient to fulfill your basic needs.Movie watching experience is decent. Anti-glare screen is good.Cons: The only drawback I have noticed is, Delay in Bootup time. It takes almost 45sec+ to load the home page (i am not sure about the Windows OS). I don't complain about it, I plug the laptop charger in the socket and clean my Workplace in mean load time..HA ha haa.."" compromise""Overall I am so happy about choosing this product. I call it  ""Value for Money"" Laptop
"
"It lags a bit but it should do fine for office or college useNot for intense coding or gamingIt's only 14 inch with in built battery n no disk driver but its very very light
"
"It is not useful to me as it is not supporting to Windows 7. As mentioned in features and details that ""This is DOS based laptop out of the box. You will need to install your own operating system ( such as Windows ) separately.""According to above features, I have purchased this laptop but now not useful to me.
"
"We bought dos version to use with Linux. First issue we faced was, WiFi not working. We contacted HP support, we got a reply  that they do not have expertise in Linux! and cant support. With some online help we could get it working but intermittently and with very low wifi strength. We started using it with LAN and after couple of weeks laptop stopped booting.With no HP support near by and easily available it lying useless now.
"
"After using 13 days, I am trying to express my views on this laptop. As I am an orthodox Linux user, I didn't find any difficulty to load a linux OS of my choice. WiFi has to be configured manually. Booting time is a bit longer. But once it boots there is no problem about the processor speed. Best deal within 25K. For those who are disappointed for not having windows 10 with is laptop, please see the specs first and then buy. It is clearly mentioned that it comes with only Free DOS. So, obviously one has to install a favorable OS in it separately. For that, one has to have the knowledge of installing an OS in a computer. AND a trick to run windows 7 and 8 is:Install a Linux OS, install Oracle virtualbox and then install windows 7, 8, or 10. It will work 100% without any problem with drivers. But windows 10 is a bit slower than windows 7 on virtualbox.
"
"Guys best choice for this price, but try to buy on this on some offer's, it will save ur money. Purchase DOS , it will save ur money around 5k. It has been a month , battery is awesome. Lap is not for gaming but still u can play some games because it is packed with i3 processor... I purchased it for 26k
"
"First determine what type of a user you are.If you are gamer, then this laptop is not for you.If you are a heavy duty user, then this laptop is not for you.If your are a multi-tasker, then again this laptop is not for you.This laptop is for those who- want light use (i3, that too 7th gen)- some office work (4GB ram, without high end graphics)- traveller (lightweight, no CD drive, plastic body)- home use to keep data (1TB drive)Speed - 3/5Storage - 5/5Design - Sleek - 5/5Keyboard 5/5If you have the windows software that you can migrate to this, use that. Else, take the windows 10 home configuration.
"
"It's been two weeks after the date of purchase. I've been using Windows 8.1 in my old laptop as I found it the simplest and fastest OS I've ever used with a 4GB Ram variant. I feel Both Windows 7 and Windows 10 a little heavier when compared to Windows 8.1. Even though I installed Win 8.1 in this model, I was unable to find suitable drivers as it is not available in HP Support and other blogs too. Then only I found a leaflet of my lap docs in which its written "" Your product does not support Windows 7 and 8. And Finally, I had to install Windows 10 which I was skeptical. But after installing Win 10, I got the drivers automatically when I connected the internet. Everything works fine except the Booting Time. I feel so sluggish while booting as its taking a couple of mins to boot up. The rest of the things like Battery and Usability are good. I dunno why its slow in booting while other things work well.
"
"I am just using the product for few days and I am just impressed. It's light waight and very fast. there is very little heating runs smoothly. This comes with DOS verson. So i have installed Windows 10 in it and windows 10 is the best thing I have seen. it's smooth and very easy to use. You can use it free and also can upgrade it, but there is no problem using it free. You will get every updates and most of the functins. You also can buy windows 10 product key in nearly 600-1500 rupees from flipkart. I have ordered one and waiting for it.just one thing this pc support only Windows 10 . It will not support windows 7,8 etc. Also ypu need to downloads drivers from their website and install them separately.this pc is very light weight and best for reading books. You can play many games . I am recently playing ""Company Of Heroes "" game , which is running just fine. i think it will handle games before 2015-16 prity well though it is not a gamming laptop.just go for it . Don't think much about installing windows 10. See some YOUTUBE videos and you will do it fine.Overall light weight,Fast and allrounder laptop. Go for it. Thanks.
"
"This is a horroble product! Please do not get cheated by buying this. It is so slow that tou can press the start button and go make tea while the system gets ready. No kidding, ot clocked 90 seconds just to open ms word. And it keeps hanging. Amazon should stop selling this!
"
"Felt cheated...no bag ...price dropped after I bought
"
"The product I received was not genuine. The power button was not working well, the Wifi wasn't connecting, the speakers had less sound and the brightness of the laptop could not be decreased.So, I exchanged the product for a new one but to my surprise, the new product had the same defects.I returned it and got my refund. I would suggest everyone to prevent buying laptops from Amazon if they don't want to have such a bad experience.Hope this helps
"
"I never expected this much of slow from a i3 7th generation with 4gb ram laptop with a poor quality LCD screen. HP is no more a trusted brand and when I tried to return this laptop Amazon said that I can't return . Only I can do is replace the laptop no money refunded . Even I tried but same performance from the replaced one. My suggestion to all please don't buy laptops from Amazon n at least not HP
"
" I'm writing this review after 4 months of owing HP 14Q CS0009TU. It's really a great product and the model can worth the money actually. I found the model useful to carry for light weight and compact design. Battery till backed me at least 8 hours once it get 100% after 4 months of heavy uses for me.This Model comes with DOS and if you try to install Linux OS, that might be hectic for you, if you're not well versed with Linux. It might be easy to purchase a Windows OS for convenience. Because this model have the issue about save windows like program. But I'm using Ubuntu 16 for last 4 months on it. One more thing, please don't compare the battery utilisation if you want to PLAY game, watch movie, Listen songs. I just told you that I'm till working 7-8 hours with coding like VS code or Atom. Keyboard, Multi gesture touch pad, speaker, Web Cam are worth of the value. Also it'll have a M2 SSD slot which will boost the performance 4x once you add it to the system. All over nice one by HP.
"
"They don't have a optical disk drive and a USB c which are available in laptops with the same configuration And price range
"
"I am using this laptop for past 2 months.Likes:Light weightKey boardSD Card slotPriceDislikes:4 GB RAM. The laptop becomes horribly slow after I open multiple applications.Added 8 GB DDR4. With 12 GB of RAM the PC performance is good. Able to open multiple applications and switching between application is pretty fast.I purchased DOS version of the laptop and installed Ubuntu.
"
"Could not use as nothing was preloadedHad to take it to a shop to load windows 10No startup manual or instructions  except a small piece of paper with very basic info to start and nothing worked...Taking to a service center nearby for help
"
"this laptop may irritate you with the non availability of wireless network driver if you install Linux, which can later be installed mannually, overall it is good battery life is great.
"
"Good entry level laptop for normal use. Based on Intel Core i3 7th Generation. No OS is provided but can be installed from local shops or by yourself. The only drawback is that no DVD drive is provided. So installing softwares provided with CD/DVD will be a tedious process. Has got good battery life. No games were tested and hence no opinion. But overall a good laptop for normal use at this price level. Highly recommended.
"
"Best for college students, just  buy  4gb ram extra, good  battery  life , pubg lite  pc works like a chat, display  and keyboard quality  is amazing. Trackpad sucks though, buy a wireless mouse and you are good to go  since it is  light in weight best for travelling  and taking it  to various hackathon and workshops. Simply amateur
"
"For daily home use like word, Excel or powerpoint even watching movies and songs .. This laptop is best in the budget.Mouse pad is slightly laggy.But overall good.
"
"At first when you see it, you think that it's a pretty good deal. That's what I thought too. But guess what? It's not even been 6 months since I have purchased it, and it's so slow that it takes about half an hour to switch on. Other than that, I've had no problems with it. It's quite lightweight, and it does pretty much everything any other laptop would do. The only problem is that it's too slow.
"
"Windows 10 is not uploaded when I received this.it wa blank.Over all its good. But it will be better if its looks glossy.
"
"It is very very slow  and i want to return the laptop.
"
"The only issue is the switch button, it too small for finger, it's as though you need to keep a finger nail to for your laptop. No one is asking for an electrical switch here. With an ssd it runs smoothly with longer battery life.
"
"The product is a light weight with almost 1.8kg and 4gb ram, sound quality is average, battery back-up is very goo 4hrs and it takes long time to fully charge. To get starting the windows it takes only 30secs.Coming to the delivery they took 6days for the delivery of this item.
"
"Don't buy it. Worst laptop in terms of performance. Hangs a lot even if you open 2 applications parallely. Chrome will start compaining no response and a black screen will appear. There are many flaws in this laptop. Don't waste your money just thinking that it is a bestseller and cheaper in price.

"Hey everyone, this is one of the latest budget oriented laptops from HP. You might have already come across it, at least a couple of times, especially in amazon deals, ‘cause this is currently the best seller here.Anyway, If you are looking for a laptop around 26k for daily usage then you are at the right place. Please consider reading my review before you look any further.Personally I have used and reviewed many laptops in amazon ,So you can totally rely on my review.Nowadays you can't trust amazon on the device specification they provide. Atleast 10% of the description section is wrong in most products.You will only know after you buy the product.And when you complain this to amazon ,you will receive this typical reply ""Apologies for the inconvenience ,Your feedback has been noted"".So just for the sake of buyers, here are the specifications.●●SPECIFICATION●●►2.3GHz Intel Core I3-7020U 7th Gen processor►Intel HD 620 Graphics (No inbuilt memory)►4GB DDR4 RAM (upto 16GB expandable)►1TB 5400rpm Hard Disk►14-inch screen,1366 x 768 pixels resolution►7 hours battery life, 3 cell 41WHr Li-ion fast charge support►DOS operating system( windows 10 supported )►1.5 kg weightNOTE: I am posting this review on 07-04-2019 and my opinions are based on today's laptop market trend.So if you are reading this after 1 year ,then definitely not the best review to rely on.Opening the box reveals a well packaged laptop, complete with lint and scratch free pouch. The top outside laptop surface is covered in a rough patterned attractive plastic that is grippy but not sticky or the normal “soft touch” that is on so many other laptop.●[DESIGN]:- This is not aluminium like the Mac, nor is this Dell XPS or Lenovo Thinkpad sturdy. It is simple plastic but at the same time, it does not feel like a cheap build either. The notebook seems to have solid build quality, For the price, it is really good. Visually, it could be mistaken for for polycarbonate. It really exudes premium from all angles (except perhaps the keyboard) .At just 1.5kg it's one the lightest I have seen.The color is gentle enough to not be gaudy, and it looks even better in sunlight than I expected.●[DISPLAY]:-The display here is not full HD as mentioned in amazon description and various dumb reviewers.It's just 1366*768 which should be enough for most users. But if you prefer to play games ,do some video editing or 3d modelling then you can always connect it to an external display with better display clarity. Anyway it works fine and looks good. It obviously doesn't look as good as higher resolutions, but it's significantly cheaper than higher res laptops.Even with the lower resolution is bright and colorful, without any edge related bright spots (in darker modes) or dead pixels. The screen backing and hinge feel solid and well built.●[GAMING -] It comes with HD 620 GPU which don't have Integrated memory ,it rather utilizes the RAM memory. It is still capable of running games like FIFA 15, DOTA 2 ,CS GO, CALL OF DUTY MODERN WARFARE and many more if you reduce the graphics settings. And ofcourse you can play the mobile versoin of PUBG.●[PERFORMANCE] -Although this is a budget laptop, it does not stick out in performance .I mean ,For normal day to day tasks such as web surfing, video playback, on demand videos, and word processing this is quite enough for many.It has the latest i3 processor which guarantees better performance than most in this price bracket.Its surely capable of handling day to day tasks with ease.Also some occasional gaming.If you are a pro with video editing and stuff then I would recommend getting something with i5 or i7.For the price point, you can expect a fraction of a second of delay when programs open but trust me when I say this processor really chugs. Sometimes sending a video into full-screen results in an ugly snap but this thing NEVER gets bogged down by programs. Operating system feels snappy. The 4GB RAM is DDR4 and it really shows: you can have a TON of things open and it continues at the same ""cruising"" pace (I wouldn't call it ""blazing"" though).●[SPEAKERS]-Speakers offer output that's quite accurate and loud enough to fill a medium-sized room.But still Not very loud.Its just OK for the price. Clarity is good but at higher volume it sounds distorted as usual.They sound similar to just about any model on the market, no major issues. You can always buy a bluetooth speaker for better and louder audio.●[TRACKPAD]-The trackpad is one of those that does have separate buttons, Not the typical windows one, but seriously better than I expected.● [WINDOWS 10] - It comes with DOS so I installed windows 10 and now the laptop flies like a flagship laptop. You just need to know how to tweak the performance. Also the drivers are available at HP website. Windows 10 automatically installs all drivers anyway.●[BATTERY ] - It comes with a 3 cell battery and as expected the battery backup is quite impressive. You can expect a backup of just 6hrs.If you are gaming then expect something like 3-4 hour. Surely a recommended one if battery life is your highest priority.●[RAM ]- 1x4GB DDR4 is fit in this model Although, for everyday computing 4GB is plentiful.With 4GB this laptop absolutely flies and never gets bogged down when I have tons of chrome windows, powerpoints, emails, and study guides open all at once. Boot time is just a few seconds.Anyway nowadays people prefer 8GB .but you don’t need to worry you can expand it anytime you want.THINGS TO BE NOTED:1) It only comes with 2 x 3.0 USB ports. The other one is USB 2.0 as usual2) no VGA port.3) Sound is average.4) Windows 7 have some issues while installation.5) Battery life is the best in this range.6)Both RAM and hardrive can be upgraded.Finally ,I probably wouldn't attempt CAD or high end video editing software on this - but if you are the type of person who uses a computer for basic accounting, email, internet, a handful of games, watching movies etc - then this is more than what you need. I also really love that this is upgradable - it is rare that you come across a laptop where you can easily upgrade the RAM and hardrive to SSD on your own.●●●FINAL VERDICT●●●●IS THIS THE BEST LAPTOP AROUND 26K?-As of today , this is one great laptop for the price. You can use at college,home or for business. As said, it's not meant for gaming, but still you can play games. It doesn’t come with windows pre-installed, so you need some technical expertise to get things right. Never take this to a shop for installing windows. They will charge hell lot of money for it and most of the times it will be pirated version.Thanks for reading my review. I hope that my review proved helpful for all users ,who are searching for a laptop in this price range.For any further info ,feel free to contact me directly or comment down below.I hope it helps.Peace☮-Abraham

"I received this laptop this morning after I ordered it yesterday in a lightening deal with a 6 month interest free EMI. I have been a user of the Macbook Air for the last 3 years and was hesitant to buy a windows laptop having gotten used to the Mac at home. But the price differential of almost 23K between this and the Macbook Air + MS Office as well as the fact that on Apple Mac I cannot save XML files easily, additional purchase of MS office, no flash player, etc. forced me to purchase this laptop yesterday. I am very impressed with it so far. Set up was easy and smooth. The Laptop has a matt finish that feels great to look and feel. It feels as light as my Macbook Air. The display is superb. The keyboard is soft to use and accurate. Boot time is a few seconds and a little slower than the Mac where it is instantaneous but that is hardly a negative here. Some people have asked if MS office comes pre-installed and the answer is YES. I just had to accept the license agreement and that was it. It also comes with a trial period of MacAfee antivirus for a month. Satisfied in every way with this purchase. Hope it is as reliable and virus free in the months and years to come as my Macbook Air. I think the 8GB Ram and the 256GB SSD combination helps in the weight and boot time for this laptop.
"
"Amazing combination THAT'S VERY, very rare to find in any brand.Pros:1.) 8th gen i5 is futureproof (there was a more than usual jump in performance bw 7th and 8th gen, so DON'T go for any of the 7th gen processors!!!)2.) SSD is blazing fast, 3-5 seconds is the boot time. 256 GB is sufficient these days, given most of our stuff stays in cloud.3.) 1080p screen is crisp and sufficiently bright4.) Build quality of laptop is above avg, but looks are very good.5.) Light weight, 14 inch form factor allows massive protability.6.) Surprisingly good battery life! The battery life is way above avg but it's actually the super low charging time which impressed me.Cons:1.) No dedicated graphics2.) Build quality and feel could have been better. The finish looks good, but attracts smudges a lot.But these cons won't really matter to folks like me who just code and don't play games.If you wanna need a powerhouse in a 14 inch 1080p screen with SSD, this one will ace the job!!!
"
"It is quiet Good Handy laptop with i5 it says it weighs 2.04 kg but it is light weight as a bookAnd also performance is better. The screen is FHDit has1.80 GHZ clock speed No Pen or Touch, 64 bit processor 8gb DDR4 and comes 247 gb of storageIt comes with pre-installed windows 10 home and Microsoft office all apps bulit-in free with the laptopIt is very black I mean if you put your hands on top surface for long time it can detect your fingerprint marks and also of more pressure sweat marks evenIt just boots in 3-4 seconds of time It is great boot up because it has ssd rather than old hdd
"
"The is a pretty good laptop for those who don't have heavy use like gaming or etc. Its  Smooth working ,Voice and camrera quality is also satisfactory . The laptop design could have been better . It leaves smudge marks of fingers on the back . Otherwise it's a COOL laptop
"
"Other than the build quality, everything else is great. Original Windows 10 (Home) & MS Office 2019 (Home). i5, ssd & 8GB Ram ensures no lag in productivity. Even 10 active tabs on chrome will not slow down the machine. Also very light. 👍👍
"
"Great product with great price and home delivery.
"
"Charger pin or cable /socket inside laptop is not proper, So it stops charging sometime !Advice what to do
"
"Since this laptop is ssd version it is very fast and realible
"
"Awsm laptop. Nice look and very fast.

"Please don't buy dell product I have bought i5 8th generation laptop on 12 April 19. since then I have done many customer complaints and replaced many parts still it's slow, takes hell lot of time to start, screen flickers and USB and headphone portal doesn't work.This piece of crap Laptop cost me Rs. 56,015 and You know the best part of this, Dell will never ever going to replace it, they will ask you to replace certain parts all the time. Every 15 days I m in customer service center to replace the part. Photo will shows you current situation of 4 month or Laptop. DONT EVER BUY DELL PRODUCT THEY DON'T THINK ABOUT CUSTOMER. I have recently lodged new customer complaint for replacement (as you can see the situation of my laptop) then I will retract my words until then please I would advise you not to use this Dell products. Each purchase from you will give the power to bully honest customers like me.FYI One start is compulsion Not my rating
"
"This has wifi connectivity issues. This laptop not even showing 5Ghz wifi network in the wifi list. Please check before buying the laptop and ensure that it has 802.11 ac wifi adapter. Don't go for 802.11b/g/n where it supports only 2.4Ghz wifi.In 2019, how can someone only use 2.4Ghz wifi adapter? HP should really change this to dual-band to support 5Ghz.
"
"The laptop charger and adapter is not compatible with the laptop. The the charger plugs in but it says not charging. I have a presentation due tomorrow. This is absolutely not reliable.
"
"Value for commercial use
"
"Unable to activate ms office home and student 2019. Guide and do the need full as  i am unsatisfied with th service
"
"Delivered exactly the same product as shown in the site. Registering the pre-installed office was somewhat difficult as it lacked proper guidance. Also there was an EMI discount shown in the final bill, but it is not actually a discount. It will be deducted through EMI. Please be clear and transparent in billing.
"
"Overall Laptop is good, but the camera quality is pathetic, they say it is HP Truevision HD Camera but it gives a blurry image similar to a VGA camera from the 90s. Will update as I use it. HP support was poor on this issue.
"
"Received my HP laptop yesterday. Its intel i5 and cost me 46,990 rupees.Literally shocked to see the quality of the laptop and it looks like its a duplicate one.Immediately called Amazon customer and their response is pathetic and they said they are not responsible for the quality and cannot do anything.Learnt my lesson  and will not be ordering any high value product from Amazon in  future.They are only good enough for groceries and small items.I will stick to Flipkart for any high value items in future.Will update the photos of the product I received shortly. Mostly I am going to throw it away.
"
"Honest review after 5 days of usage.If you have to write a lot but it doesn't requires a numpad (if you're not an accountant/involved with number) then, having a properly centered keyboard with a 14"" screen is ideal if you have to often carry your laptop around (maybe at school or college)I have bought the i5 + 8 GB RAM with Office 2019 versionPros:1. Crisp keys. Great typing experience.2. It came with pre-installed office 2019 and windows 10 home.3. Pretty good battery. The battery optimization scroll function which lets you balance battery life and performance is very helpful.4. Great touchpad with multiple gesture functions, some of which are like Macbook's. You can switch between apps using 3 finger swipes. You can go back to desktop from anywhere with downwards 3 finger swipe. You can go to tabs view with upwards 3 finger swipe. You can open notification panel with 4 finger tap. You can even enable horizontal and vertical scroll for the touchpad. It will work on the touchpad borders once you turn it on. The touchpad settings software is a must to customize and makes working much faster.5. Dark mode is great and works universally.6. Light weight and can easily be carried around using a single hand.7. Additional slot for SSD expansion. You can make it hybrid storage.8. Great color and screen contrast.9. Almost every element of the system is highly customizable and that's great.Cons :1. It is already thin, but with its weight and size, it could be thinner.2. You cannot change your username under C:/users if you while logging in for the first time logged in with Microsoft account. If you do that, Microsoft will take the first 5 letters of your email and make it your permanent username. You won't be able to change that.I'd suggest initially logging in without logging into anything and just skip the option. That way you can change your own username. I had reset the whole computer because it was annoying. I don't know why Microsoft can't fix something so small.3. No anti-glare screen. If a light reflection is there you just gotta increase the brightness 🤷🏼‍♂️4. The bezels could've been thinner.5. Doesn't comes with a bag.It's not the laptop that sucks in any way. It's Microsoft windows, the most mainstream OS of the world that sucks. Windows 10 certainly has a much larger scope of customization compared to previous windows.This laptop is built more for professional usage but you can easily run mid tier games. However if you're looking more towards gaming and less towards MS office, you can get a laptop in SAME PRICE RANGE with nvidia graphics but then you probably won't get office.Overall, the pros overweigh the cons. This is probably the best 14"" laptop between 40-50k. If your budget is near 50k, put 2 thousand more and buy that HP 14 with the same features + 256 GB SSD and silver colour. BUT if your budget is less than that, You probably won't find a better option with office 2019 lifetime validity.Must buy if you're involved in typing a lot of professional stuff since it has pretty well laid out keyboard with preloaded office.Do like if you found this useful.Feel free to ask any questions!!

"Screen doesn't works.. The quality is not good. It is the worst product i had ever bought. Totally disappointed with this product. Please refund this. Display doesn't works. Bad name for HP company
"
"Don't even think of buying this product. I bought it on EMI, 39990 rs. It's very slow.. It takes 10 minutes to start. I am trying to return it since last fifteen days, and get my money back. So, that I can buy another one. But every day the coustmer executive says it will be done within two days for sure but I don't know what is wrong with amazon it could not done even after fifteen days. They are getting interest from this money and deliberately trying to postpone it. I could have given - 🌟 if was possible. Battery life is OK. To buy it is total waste of money, time and energy. Only good thing about this product is that it is light weight and looks good.
"
"i am surprise that in the discription screen it was written with MS officei was disappointed when i saw its a 30 days trial software ...now my daughter is in a fix tht wht will happen after 30 we have buy  MS office seprately ...totally disappointed by Amazon for the first time in life..

"Totally 😥. Ordered 8GB RAM, 1TB hard drive, 14 inch hp, Windows 10, i5...ButGot14 inch, Dual core AMD processor,256 GB hDD, 4GB RAM.DisappointedPls replace with original... Item..
"
"Waste product

"corrupt display driver sent
"
"Probably one of the best around the specified price rangeI would recommend to go for it.But, there's no office with lifetime validity.You'll have to install a crack from the internet or share someone's Microsoft account for accessing the complete features of the office 365 and it's applications.Battery is amazingAudio is also greatAll in all, if you are looking for a good laptop for work and a little bit of gaming, then this one is worth buying
"
"The laptop is really good. It has intel core i5 processor 8th generation, windows 10 lifetime. It comes with MS Office 2019 (Word, Excel, Powerpoint, OneNote) lifetime validity, you just need to activate it online. The video of how to activate is given on amazon website. The delivery was good and on time. The audio quality of the speaker is nice. It is best for students and professionals. I bought it on offer and got a really nice price for it.
"
"Please don't buy this product. Its a waste of money.Screen is not good. Body is made up of complete plastic material.Request Amazon to block this seller.
"
"A very attractive color and body. Very light weight. Very thin and looks just like A notebook. It's speed is great. Battery life is a little average. The best for college students.
"
"Battery life is good. More than 5 hours for simple work like documents.Weight is light. Easy to carry.Although these days one would expect a fast startup than this, at this cost this is a valuable laptop. HP could try to make a variant with some added SSD memory and give a faster startup. This could increase the cost by 2000-3000 rupees.
"
"Laptop is light weighted because it’s body has very poor quality plastic is there in the body.Even thought it has latest processor and 8 GB RAM, my Dell laptop with 4GB and I3 is way faster than this new product.I got it with the back date warranty registered that means I got someone’s replacement piece but Amazon has nice rules that with performance issues replacement is also not possible.I am a regular buyer with Amazon but they disappointment me with purchase.Will not recommend to buy this product.
"
"A very nice and light weight laptop. Battery  lasts for 4/5 hours in a single charge. Up till now it is functioning smoothly. Value for money. Thanks team Amazon for nice packaging and timely supply.
"
"Its very good product ..light weight and powerfull device packed up with core i5 processor 8 generation..good graphics of intel.... loud and clear speaker. if the keyboard would have backlit then it would best in these price range i buyed in 38 k in offer..the resolution is not soo best but good enough to watch movies... Battery is good .... Overall a good deal😊

"First of all, this is after 15 days of daily usagePros:1)Windows 10 OS is pre-installed with Microsoft office, Which is great to use.2)No heating issues or heavy fan sounds so far3)Core i5 8th Gen is no doubt faster, Compare to core i3 I have used previously. Also, its 8265U which goes up to 3.9ghz. Better than most i5 you see online.4)build quality is good.5)The touchpad is good and as per expectation, so is the keyboard.6)extremely Light weight and its the best thing about this laptop.Cons:1)Battery life is not as per given 7 hours, it is hardly 5 to 6 hours2)Not a full HD display as might expect, but its more than enough for media consumption and daily productivity or coding etc. Also, it has anti-glare feature which is a plus pointOverall, go for this laptop if you are using your laptop in the evening or somewhere around 5 to 6 hours, will not recommend for official work or heavy gaming.

"I was told that exchange will be done, but when person came he refused to exchange saying since battery is not working, can't complete the deal. Now my order status shows, that I am the one who refused to take. I also asked, if it is possible for me to pay balance amount by other methods, at least let me have laptop, to which i was simply refused. This was truly a bad experience for me.I would suggest everyone to be cautious of such exchange deals on Amazon
"
"Nice one. Happy to have it.
"
"Good.
"
"Doni buy online products by seeing photos & reviews
"
"The laptop is excellent except for the look
"
"Awesome product ... I felt sound is low...
"
"Battery drains in two to three hours. Rest is ok. If black colour available, it will  be most graceful. Screen resolution is not good
"
"Pros:Extraordinary battery life which is lasting about 7 hrs, butter smooth keypad and lightweight.Cons: It's not  Full HD, it's HD ready display with lower resolution. Installation problems with attached printer and scanner is big issue as downloaded online drivers are older and not compatible with windows 10. Need a lot of ""jugar"" to install the printer and scanner with this PC. If you call customer care they tell  you  like this"" though your PC is in the warranty but attachable  auxiliary  devices are not in the warranty or it is not there responsibly of other companies scanner like cannon"" and send you to local HP Customer Care with chargeable module of Rs. 800/-. So, this is completely unethical.
"
"Fantastic
"
"In this range good choice, go for it. :-)
"
"Light in weight and effective for day to day task. Only draw back is that it doesn't have keypad panel lights.
"
"Specifications are fine and performance is also good but the built quality is not good.
"
"Very bad product touchpad is not working
"
"Re reviewing : after 2 months usageThe screen has a horizontal line now. Was told that it needs replacement . Service guy came after almost a week and replaced it since it was just two months .Seriously ? Just two months and the screeners spoilt. Big mistake . Should have opted for dell .To begin with , POWER switch is  a joke. Needs to be upgraded. Not sure How many months it will lastSpeed is slow. .Keypad and mouse pad are GoodBattery is decentScreen is ok. Not bad .Weight wise it 8s superb . Compact and apperars solid.
"
"Great!!
"
"This is a worse one, there are many issues in it1. WIFI disconning automatically2. Very low performance3. sometimes power button doesn't working, this is due to worse button design4. Taking more time to login page after press the power button.5. Packing was alsonot good.My suggestion is, please don't go to buy this product.
"
"Light weight and good battery life. Its too new, will know more with time.
"
"Overall... Hmm... Okk
"
"Excellent product in available range
"
"Its not a very good laptop.
"
"Please don't go with their i3 version as its damn slow to work instead choose this one and it works really better. I use for development purpose apart from doing simple daily work and it never lags when it comes to performance. The build quality is better than Dell / Lenovo that are in this price range.
"
"This laptop is best for work and almost small games can easyly be played on this i play pubg mobile its working great without gpu too BUT I SUGGEST EVERYONE TO GET IT FROM OFFLINE STORE YOU WILL GET MANY ACCESSORIES WITH IT ALSO YOU CAN CLAIM ANY DAMAGE EASYLY..... THANK YOU HP FOR THIA WONDERFUL LAOTOP...
"
"Overall good except battery remain for 4 to 4.5 hours..
"
"No backlit Keyboard, its confusing. Really is there or not?
"
"I have not used it pretty much but until now it looks good..... It's a budget laptop with such a beautiful design. Performance wise I have not installed any heavy softwares so I am not very sure of it. Until now it looks good. Just it's a bit heavy from what I had assumed.
"
"Well what to say. Received on 9 th aug used for approx 13 days maybe about 2 hrs a day and today the screen goes blank  No display totally blank. Took half hour to get HP to register a complaint and they will Take 2 to 3 working days for a site visit. A brand new laptop with this problem!!!!  Lets see the after sales service of HP
"
"Good product,Performance is good for both programming and daily usage,Awesome battery backup.
"
"The product that i have received is defective, the windows keeps crashing constantly and the screen goes blank with small square lines appearing on the screen. This has a 5th Gen i5 processor and should be capable of performaing tasks withing seconds but this product is so slow that it makes me question whether this was a new piece provided to me by amazon or not. The constant hanging of apps and the screen going black and the display showing all sorts of messages that functions cannot be performed has left me to conclude that amazon has delivered a defective product.
"
"This is great laptop worth its price. Its colour is very sexy and looks very good. Magnificent features are there I reccomend u to buy this laptop
"
"It a wonderful laptop from hp
"
"Battery life is good and easy to handle due to less weight. Not tried too much for gaming but when tried performance is good.
"
"How to activate Office Home &student . How will get Activation key ? Is it free of cost with this laptop ?Product description saying have keyboard back light feature but laptop key board back light not working. So we cant identifying power switch is  on or off ..
"
"Product is very nice as per features mentions in the detail and I expected. Worth value. Design, performance, screen is good.
"
"I dont like it.-->Plastic is very delicate and if even press from fingers it will get dented.-->Screen is just normal and even it's hardly visible from different angles. You will have to adjust pannel again and again.-->If you want to upgrade anything than its very difficult as opening back cover is like climbing the mountain. I don't like it at all. You will surely endup breaking something.--> Wifi only supports single channel and you wont receive 5Ghz signal so max you will get 50-60 Mbps. It's 15 years old module. And on Airtel 100 Mbps connection you will get max 38 Mbps. You will have to buy usb adapter dual channel separately.--> m.2 internal port doesn't supports nvme SSD. It only supports non nvme m.2 ssds.I would say it's ok ok and should max price at Rs 35000--> Keyboard keys hardly visible and i feel so repented when the letters are not visible.--> Speakers just average nothing special

"Does gta 5 works good
"
"I have purchased for my work purpose and i am satisfied with the quality and processor. Excellent.
"
"Silver color keyboard  not comfortable for working.bought key board cover.
"
"The laptop is ok in the price range. For normal use only. Takes longer time to start. The vendor had already installed and activated the macafee antivirus which is unacceptable although I did not complaint against it. The windows was activated and thereby the warranty of the system was only for 7/8 months left. This is unethical and very unacceptable too. Amazon should resolve these issues and make-up to that.
"
"This laptop is great.I like the design looks and performance.what i found disappointing is the display quality i can't find good colors on display as others laptop brands also viewing angles are not good.The Hard drive is slow takes time in opening apps.But Performance and processing is top notch... I am a developer i never compromise with performance... So i think is a great choice.

"This is a good laptop for new learners. Everything is fine except the slowness. Since I bought this for my kids, I have no complains. But if you are thinking to use it and you are fast, avoid this. Even after updating the system, finetuning the applications this still behaves slow. Its been nearly one month for me now. Touch screen works perfectly fine. This is a very good laptop for reader, new learners, school students.
"
"The product is hopelessly slow .. I had purchased it for simply office work .. preparing word docs etc. It takes forever to start and has very slow in responses . I fail to understand why is it even in existence. My 7-8 years old desktop and laptop are more efficient than this laptop. Not worth it. Won't recommend.

"Hey everyone! HP CORE 15 is a newly launched laptop with core  i3 7th gen and touch screen. But It's not that the new, considering that it's using the same design and chassis as last year. But leaving that aside, this is really a good contender for best affordable touch screen laptop.It does get competition from Lenovo Yoga, over here amzn.to/32Dv66f and HPs own 8th gen model here amazon.in/HP-Pavilion-14-inch-Touchscreen-14-dh0101TU/dp/B07QNM6NSFBut the Lenovo one is only a 14inch screen, although it features fullHD display, far leaner and lightweight design only its Yoga, so you can go 360.The HP one is quite expensive at 45K, but it offers 8th gen cpu and SSD storage. So it gets a huge bump when it comes to performance.Now what I to say about this laptop:========================1. First thing, the build quality is very good & the design is classy. Very much portable thanks to the thin & light build.2. Display is vibrant & very good only with more brightness, with less brightness the image seems to be washed out. viewing angles aren't great either due to the anti glare coating.3. Sound output is clear but not loud enough.4. Performance is ok. no issues with that. I was able to multitask without any lags.5. Island-style Keyboard is good and feels fantastic on the press. Backlight addition would've been perfect.6. Battery backup is good enough (5-6 hours of SOT). Tends to drain quickly when Wifi, High-intensity games are active. Also when CPU/GPU is put to the threshold.7. There are no heating issues with daily usage whatsoever.========================After considering all these aspects, features and price, it's a good buy. But the lenovo one offers slightly better value for money with its iconic design. And don't forget the HP one I mentioned, it features SSD.So I would give the Lenovo one the crown for best touch screen laptop at 35K. But as I brand I prefer HP. So the decision is yours to make :).I hope it helps.-Aj
"
"Not Bad
"
"Touch is good but system is quiet slow
"
"Slow some time very slow, pls don't buy, hanging problem also apps take long time to open & maximum time can't open only blank screen you how to restart again restart.I can't suggest this configuration it is completely waiste of moneyPLS DON'T BUY
"
"Laptop is awesome. But support is not good. Pre installed Windows 10 and MS Office. I asked amazon to get the Cds of Windows 10 and Office including keys. But they refuse to send those items.

"HP brand laptop with perfect Amazon packing. But I mentioned one important point nowadays intel 7th gen processor it support win 10 pro 64 bit only . Not supported windows 7 32 or 64 bit. Because Microsoft stopped windows 7 and 8. O don't know AMD . Screen is backlit led so worst screen performance. No anti glare, center of the screen little dual. Otherwise keyboard touch pad very Good. HP support customer care quickly answer to my question. Charging backup very amazing 😍.more 4 hours . Simply super.

"Product is really awesome😍😍.But,packageing is not so good.There was no airbag in the packet.. I got no bill with the package.
"
"Purchased it from the local Hp world with the gaming bag free worth 4k. I bought it for 1.15k and its worth the price with gtx 1660 ti. Very fast boot up and very smooth rendering..and good for high end games..really love the model.
"
"Okay I have been using it for almost two months now. General Performance wise I have no complaints. Boots up in seconds and is super fast for day to day tasks like web browsing, Video streaming, emails etc.I use it for music production with FL Studio and various third party plugins and no matter how heavy the project is, there are absolutely no complaints.Now for the gaming part, 90% of the games I played in it there were no issues in High/Ultra settings and 1080p (The latest CODs, Mass Effect Andromeda, Battlefield 1 etc). PUBG will stutter at highest settings so I recommend 720p with medium settings for a lag free performance.I would recommend a cooling pad while using the laptop for gaming as it gets pretty hot and thermal throttling could be an issue here if you are not using it on adequate surfaces (for example if you like playing on your bed). I use an external monitor and gaming set while at home so it’s easy to just dock it to a cooling pad. If you are playing directly on the laptop using the laptop keyboard, Play around with pad adjustments until you find a position that is ergonomically suitable for you.Battery life is average at best during gaming. I could play just about 2 full rounds of CODBO4 in the highest settings at 1080p and 3.5 rounds of PUBG in Medium settings at 720p before the low battery mode kicked in at 20%. Though to be honest I never use my laptops on battery while heavy usage and always carry my adapter around wherever I go.On the other hand, battery backup was pretty decent while streaming videos or other day to day tasks. You can easily watch 2 full movies at 80% brightness and still have some juice left before it reaches 20%.All in all, this is a good machine at a really good price, especially for Intermediate gamers like me. If you are a Pro gamer, then HP Omen series are what you should be looking at instead of this.

"The product's design, appearance, and performance are really good and worth the price. But the in-build programs such as the Anti-virus and MS-Office that comes along has trial subscription only.

"Hey guys im a student and i play games daily for atleast 3-4 hours.. Before buying this I have seen many laptops.. First i had the fear of spending 70k on this laptop because the same specs is available in 60k laptop but somehow i managed to buy this.. After buying im fully satisfied.. Im writing this review because i don't believe in reviews but trust me this is genuine review..one of the best laptop available in the market..
"
"Bought it from local vendor. It's a great product in competiton with Legion y540
"
"This laptop is great! Bought it from HP Store at ₹66200 after discounts and the usage has been amazing.The performance is amazing with a 9th Gen i5 processor and the Nvidia 1050 graphics processor.I am not so much of a gamer but I needed a graphics processor for personal tasks like Android Studio, Premiere Pro, After Effects, etc. Games like Need For Speed, Asphalt, Grand Theft Auto, Assassin's Creed, etc also work smoothly on high settings and without any frame drops.The sound is okayish. The volume is clear even at full and it gets pretty loud. However the laptop lacks bass. I generally keep it around 40-50.The keys are okay to type on. Key travel is good and the purple lighting is a treat to look at. It can get a bit bright at night though, even at the lower setting (there are two - low and high), because the sides of the keys also light up along with the text on them. But the keys are a bit mushy. The keyboard does not have a dedicated menu key which I did not see while buying but I used a third party program to configure the right Alt as the menu key. Also, it lacks a sleep function button.Ports will never be an issue here. It contains 3 USB-A 3.1 Gen 2 ports, 1 USB-C port, ethernet jack, one combo audio-in/audio-out jack, SD card reader. One of the USB-A and the USB-C ports are always on so you can just connect your phone with a cable and keep them in your backpack and it'll charge even when the laptop is off.The screen could be brighter and more contrasty. The sharpness is amazing though. 1080p on a 15.6 inch display is really good. The saturation can be adjusted in Intel Graphics Settings to around 10-15% and it looks great.It doesn't even heat up that much as the fans kick up and keep the laptop cool. They can get pretty loud though.The battery life can get upto 8-9 hours of you tweak some settings right but mostly for normal use it lasted around 5-6 hours.I was confused between a lot of laptops at around 70k but when I heard of the discount this caught my attention. I've been using HP since a very long time and never did I face any issue with the brand.I'd suggest that ask for this laptop in nearby HP stores or the likes of Croma if you can get it at a cheaper price, but even at 72k this is a great laptop.
"
"Guys this laptop is best but remember one thing always pull your screen from centre don't open screen from the sides or any other side only open it from center it has been broken two times in my case. All the way this machine is best in series🤘🏻.
"
"Very Astonishing look . Very smooth performance .No lag yet... The only problem i felt is it becomes too hot on overclock gaming. That is the only problem i felt. Using a cooling pad avoids this. It is a best laptop for gaming and designers and good at this price
"
"In love with this beauty😍😍...its a bit heavy yet too sturdy...I didn't get any laptop bag neither mouse nor a WARRANTY CARD...I think you should buy from a hp store and get all goodies and technical support

"I have run all games all games like gta 5 , forza horizon 3,4, assassins creed all at high and ultra graphics with 60 to 70 frames per second.Battery life is ok gives about 4-5hrs which is pretty good for a gaming laptop, minimal heating after playing for 3-4 hrs.
"
"Very better

"This laptop is super cool . It gives excellent quality gaming experience. But the battery lasts for only 1.5hr at gaming. But it gives a far better performance at normal usage of about 4 to 5hrs.👍👍👍

"My first preference is Dell but this one comes with 256GB of SSD alongside 1 TB of HDD so although it has only 4GB of RAM i ordered it. I am quite satisfied. Details are lacking from seller so let me provide the actual specs:Hardware:- Core i5 (8th Gen)- 4GB RAM- 256 GB SSD +1 TB HDD- Full HD display- DVD reader/writer- Integrated graphics (Intel UHD 620)- 2x USB 3 port on the left and 1 USB2 port on the right.- Card reader: yes- Keyboard is not backlit.Software:- OS: comes preloaded with Windows 10 Home. You need to activate it over the internet. Licence is for lifetime.- MS office: laptop comes with MS Office Home and Student 2019. You need to activate it. License is for lifetime. (You get word, excel, powerpoint in this pack, other features need to be bought separately).- Cyberlink Power Media 14 with lifetime license.- McAffee anti virus with 1 month license.Other details:- Packing was below standard.- Display is poor/not bright enough even at brightest setting. This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.

"First time have received one defective product (one USB port was not working) , after great assistance and service from amazon ,got the replacement.New product is totally in good working state and no defect in hardware section.Thanks to amazon for your great commitment.Product Review:-Laptop performance is totally satisfactory.Someone thinks that 4 gb ram is not enough but i will suggest if you are purchasing for daily use and littlebit of programming then this laptop value for money.Under 40k this is worthy laptop.No lagging,no heating till now after 1 week of using.

"Dont hesitate to buy becoz it is such a great product with low price. I bought the product, in offline hp store so they upgraded for 8gb for free with the same price, 256ssd with this price u will never get it even in other brand, go take it and upgrade to 8gb ull love it.I see so many reviews about display is not that good, all r wrong, display is fine,dont worry.It has everything only lacks with graphic card it has only intel uhd620 which is fine for normal gaming.If u want ssd with in this price plz go for it and upgrade it to 8gb as it has extra slot, I got it for free in ofline store.Used for one month no conflicts everything is good.Main important is it boots within 6 seconds and it has office 2019 with lifetime version no worries for Microsoft.Plz go for it dont hesitate to buy.

"Well after going through all the websites  & reviews finally decided on this one. It doesn't have dvd writer but very slim & light weight.It also offers anti glare screen.8 GB ram works like butter.Go for it.Around 31 k paid under sale. Unfortunately I bought through GRAB A GADGET & found they replaced the original charger with cheap one. I request all of you just go to the company store and buy genuine goods instead of saving 1000/500 Rs.  Although machine is good but my entire happiness has gone.

"In images there is disc drive but in originalProduct there is not a disc drive....!!
"
"Good laptop, lightweight as it does not include optical disk drive,includes windows 10 & microsoft office home with life time warranty. Read a lot reviews about the laptop being slow and initially did face the problem. The problem did get solved by stopping most of the unessential apps/programs running in the background also uninstalled McAfee antivirus software and installed Kaspersky total security and that greatly helped in improving the booting and overall activity speed. I have no issues now wrt speed. Good for routine work, not suitable for gaming. Suits my type of routine work satisfied. Deserves a 4 star but given it a 5 star as I got it at a generous price and exchange  offer during Great Indian festival Sale.
"
"Initially when we get this laptop. If u can send one service engineer at free cost, to demo the laptop, it will be better. We could not get the doubts clarified.But, if we buy from store, we get service support from service engineer. This facility is missing, buying through oniine. May be, we get price difference buying through online. But, demo by expert makes lot of difference.

"Don't buy this laptop as it doesn't support 5GHz wifi band which is common in airtel and jio giga fibre for better speed (like 100 Mbps) . Now i have to live with 2.4 GHz WiFi band speed only. Pathetic description and Amazon is equally resposbile for this fault. My 10 years old laptop Compaq 510 support 5 GHz band while this year 2019 HP model doesn't support what a irony for all HP user.

"All things are good but Battery backup is very low. Need Battery replacement.
"
"I have opted this for its battery life claims and light weight touch screen. But battery life is maximum 3-4 hrs even for slight to moderate usage. Looking good and lightweight. It is lagging bit with multi tasks. I have added another Samsung 8GB ram. Now it is working smoothly..Minimum 8GB requires for better performance. This is not for gaming .
"
"I received the product in time.  The display is okay.  It has the latest 1903 update installed.  It comes with a 265gb of ssd hdd space.  Free scapce 206 gb.  SSD will give you good boot time and multi tasking pros but this is not for one who is loking to save music, movies and all thise stufs. It has a sd slot which could be used to increase memory.  MS office work great.  The KB  has backlit.FHD screen, MS office,  256SSD, BL keyboard are the key features.  Good buy for 47990 . Price might decrease 1k in flash sales but not more I guess.
"
"wonderful product ...it takes care of all basic needs like WORD PPT EXCEL etc. .drawing , highlighting important items in text , adding finer details into various items in PPT s , hand writing notes lot many things can be done .. seems like battery drains fast initially but it is acceptable..no issues with touch screen it is smooth ...screen is Full HD ..slim bezels ...key board is backlit ..typing experience is like pressing into smooth rubber , enjoyed typing ..there is some play in the screen hinges may need some support like thick book at the back, it is difficult to concentrate and type on the screen while on move sitting in a car , due  to screen wobbling ...the experience is smooth while changing from one app to another  but not very fast especially videos .. may be due to 4 GB RAM ..the speakers have very good sound reproduction...
"
"Overall erformance is good the only issue is that 4.30 hr battery back up
"
"HP has improved the quality and finish to make this convertible comparable to MacBook Air though it is heavier . The battery charges quickly but does not last for full 10 hours .The Full HD display is good and touchpad has gestures. There is slight wavery screen flicker when you scroll fast and hence is not smooth to watch.Other than this the Keys are smooth to use and battery charge has indicator on laptop side. The power button also has been moved to the side.Overall with MS Office Home version ,Inkpen and Windows 10 included  this is a quality product from HP
"
"The product is useless. The support just refers to service center for simple queries like what is max ram supported? Lenovo and other have everything on site. Nothing called product manual. The article onsite that shows opening is incorrect or outdated(no screws in place). HP is worst when it comes to customer orientation and their products suck.I'll never buy anything from HP even if they give it for free.Product doesnt support some apps due to screen setting of HP. Worst money waste. You can buy DELL or apple that actually works
"
"Pros-Quality screen and light weight. 2 in 1 laptop, Included ms office. Cons- noisy fan, clumsy backspace button, loose touch pad, worst battery life. HP customer care is worst and doesn't know that this model exists. HP website says no driver available for this product. If you can live with these you can buy otherwise a big no. Replacement item also had all these issues in addition to a new issue of product been registered 2 months back and only 10 months warranty. Terrible experience
"
"Excellent product for the price . Could have included some protector case as it has 360 fold . Though can be upgraded from 4gb ram to 12 gb ram within 15 mins or less.

"Let's break this review into 5 parts:1.Overall look2.Performance3.Software experience4.Battery life5.Other features1.Overall lookFirst of all lookwise the laptop looks very very premium.The build quality is certainly very good on this and the best part of the build quality is that it does not flex at all.The top seems to be made up of some magnesium or aluminium alloy, the keyboard layout and surrounding material.also seesm to be of aluminium .The bottom section is of high quality plastic based.The power button on the side glows when you are using the laptops and seems to be cool.Overall the laptop very finely built.2.PerformanceNow speaking of the performance I must say I am impressed here.Dont judge this laptop by its processor.even though it has core i3-8145U 8th generation processor but this processor has turbo boost a feature that had never been seen before in any i3 processor.It has a base frequency of 2.1Ghz and during turbo boost it can clocked upto 3.9Ghz and believe me guys it just blazing fast.Laptop seems very snappier.It has a Samsung 2433 MHz RAM and it is really fast.Now the most important thing about any laptop is the kind of storage used in it.Here we have SSD.let me clear this , the SSD used here isnot SATA based , it is a m.2 PCIe based NVME SSD Toshiba SSD and I think this is the main contributing factor for this laptop performance.Since it is using a SSD perfoance is very good plus booting time is hardly 7-8 seconds.The keyboard has a nice feeling to it while typing and it has backlit.The bang and Olufsen speaker are also very crisp and clear and descently loud.Since this laptop has SSD,I am.happy to say it has no heating issues.The screen is full HD IPS LCD display and it is very ubrant in Colors.The brightness is good and it is sharp Plus it is touchscreen.HP seems to include fast charging here as the laptop charges 64 percent in 50 minutes which is very good.Now speaking about battery life,battery life is descent with 6-10hours of battery life.After I started using this laptop, I received a BIOS update and after that the battery backup seems to be good . I got 7.00 hrs of battery backup with this laptop.In context of I/O port it has two usb 3.1 ports which is rare in this price segment , a type c port and an HDMI port,alongwith headphone jack(oh my god!).3.Software ExperienceThe laptop is powered by windows 10 May 2019 update (1903) and since it's windows 10 you will get software updates and future windows version along the road.It came with a full version of 2019 which needs to be activated I activated the same without having any issues.4.Battery lifeBattery included in 41 Watts and can lasts upto 6-10 hours of battery life.5.Other featuresThe trackpad included here is windows precision trackpad.The included HP pen is really very cool and has very very low latency.Also.the laptop is 360 degrees rotatable and hence can be used it tent mode,360 mode and tablet mode also.Final verdict the laptop is very good.Hp has certainly improved their quality of product.The only concern is the 256 GB of storage I suggest to purchase an external.hard drive if not you can upgrade the m.2 SSD also.Just don't believe on anything negative regrading the laptops.Only processor will not make a laptop gudIt's the whole package that integrates with the laptop make it a good one.If u want a lightweight and powerful laptop go with this one One important thing to note is if you purchased another variant of this laptop with 720p HD screen then it don't have a backlit keyboard and display is certainly less sharper than 1080p one.Delivery feedback:Last thing i want it share is the pathetic Amazon delivery service.The laptop shipped in time and also reached my city.But the delivery agent  don't what wrong with him made it out for delivery at 9pm and after repeatedly calling him haven't received the call and around 1.00 am in night started blank calling him.The next day it came to me that the laptop was not returned back to couriers but in the possession of the agent for whole day.I had to escalate the matter at the higher level and after continue following up the next whole day they deliver my laptop.A word of advice from me, if you are writing this laptop for this price in the local ho.store then please purchase from it as Amazon has no control over their delivery agents.And Amazon please do consider this feedback seriously as agents are not allowed to call after 9.00pm certainly not at 1.00AM in the morning I guess!
"
"What a wonderful piece -Display is very very attractive and awesome and  with SSD every time on and off is like mobile power button very fast and doing work with this laptop is interesting.
"
"Almost a month gone and it's really good in terms of overall performance. Before installing antivirus the battery was bit better but now consuming more. However it's really good so not having any issues. Touch screen is great it would better if HP start providing screen guard for touch screen laptops. PC is fast and performing as per my expectations. However, I am not playing games.
"
"Other than the battery part,Everything else is good.You get MS Office pre installed with a lifetime licence.Display Quality is just great as comparing to other brand for that price.Again,this model is not for someone who wants to store lots of movies or play games.The memory capacity is limited to 256GB In which you get to access 213 GB of it.So its not for everyone.
"
"Fast deliveryGood conditionSatisfied operating8k video compatibleNice clearityNoce pen quality.But..  No fingerprint readerAudio jack 3 mm.. U can't get usually that headphone..Inbuilt speakers good.Gestures and shortcuts good.Fast use.. And user friendly..Split screen etc.

"The product spec is good with touch, convertible, SSD and light weight 1.56 kg. Memory support is only 2444Mz but installed 2666 Samsung DDR4. Features in HP site says 10 hour backup under test condition as ""Battery life tested by HP using continuous FHD video playback, 1080p (1920x1080) resolution, 150 nits brightness, system audio level at 17%, player audio level at 100%, played full-screen from local storage, headphone attached, wireless on but not connected. Actual battery life will vary depending on configuration and maximum capacity will naturally decrease with time and usage."".I was attracted seeing this battery backup. I checked for the box new laptop and fully charged but shows me only 4 hour and 30 minutes. Contacted HP support team and did all battery calibration and driver update but no benefit visible.

"Amazing product. As expected.

"Good performance,Full display, but missing backlit keyboard and fingerprint scanner

"No doubt that x360 is one of the finest looking laptops in this range and no one is going to get disappointed by purchasing it, unless you are really picky with your tech. But just so you know, this is not an all new product, it uses THE body of the previous gen x360, and only the CPU is upgraded to 10th gen. So it comes with the same flaws as the previous gen.Note: The only other option, which comes close to this laptop is this lenovo laptop here  amzn.to/2O27WzJ  But it features a full HD display and comes with same office and windows 10 bundle. and yes its SSD.Also at the time of reviewing the product is sold @ 45k-WHAT'S BAD?1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) Display is still not good for a 45k laptop ,the viewing angles could have been better.-WHAT'S GOOD?1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is includeD.7) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.8) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.9) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.10) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.11) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.12) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.13) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.14) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn't feel any change in my typing speedOverall a great deal, although the display is a deal breaker for me. So if that's the case with you, please check the lenovo lap I suggested above, it features the same package but with a better display. Don't mind the 8th gen cpu though, its equally capable as the 10th gen and the difference is negligibly small.I hope it helps someone out there :)

"The mouse pad was damaged and there is no option for return or replacement. It just has a hp customer number to call and it is not getting connected either. U don't have option to return straight away when you found the item is damaged. Pathetic!
"
"A wonderful piece to begin with. Good hardware along with latest software. Dual speakers give excellent sound quality. Screen too is good. Not yet tried any games but surely it will be a great experience considering the Nvidia 2 GB graphics card and stunning 8 GBs of RAM.
"
"packing first of all. LAN port and one USB port are loose, gets disconnected very frequently, eventually can't use the USB port. Also the product is made in China. Don't know whether original or not!
"
"It's very slow.. the screen takes forever to open.. certainly not performance I would expect for a  8GB RAM machine, more of 512Mb RAM, it's that slow.
"
"I really satisfied with this product.
"
"Amazing laptop at this price range
"
"Laptop is as per the specifications. Delivery was prompt. Very nice Laptop and useful and recommended for other to purchase.
"
"Build quality is good but you can get much more specifications in this price if you buy lenovo or Asus laptops
"
"All things work wellBut there some irritating problem with the OS
"
"Pretty decent product with futuristic configurations and performance...
"
"Nice one product
"
"Boot up speed is slow. It takes a lil longer than usual to get goin from sleep mode. Great battery! Charges pretty fast.The product looks very stylish. (The one with silver keypad). Great sound quality. Its loud and crystal clear. One thing which hurts me the most after buying this one is the display.Anti glare is great. Bt hp cud have included an ips panel here. Viewing angles are bad. I wish i cud get an ips panel with it , rest everything is great. For multitasking, playing games and day to day use its a great laptop to buy. But if you r someone who watches a lot of movies then u shud not go for this one.
"
"I like this over all good
"
"Nice resolution
"
"It don't have 45Wh battery. It only has 41Wh battery and can charge from 0 to 100 in 1.5 hours. Best reliable laptop. But the tn panel is bad. And mouse driver will not work well unless u troubleshoot hardware devices manually. U have the greatest speed. But the audio fluctuates when it is 100%(you can control the fluctuation by using HP audio ccontrol app and set it to genre rock) Overall not worth the money, but it is great for softwares for students like me. Also it has office 2016 and McAfee 30days trial. Battery life is phenomenal as compared to the size of the battery. I am getting around 6 hours ease( internet browsing and viewing 2 pdfs and annotating them at 0% brightness under better battery mode). If it had an SSD, it will be worth. I noticed that the sound fluctuates at higer volumes. For a workaround, go to hp audio control and turn down all the sliders to minimum(dialog clarity, etc) and then press music and then uncheck audio enhancements. you will loose some sound quality  but the sound never distorts.
"
"Really awesome in this price range...if u r looking for brand then go for it... If not then u can go for asus or acer with same feature...Pros: good battery, good touch pad, nice screen , windows life timeCons: little heavy, sound quality is poorBut for service go for it
"
"I bought this lappy offline 1 week ago & I'm happy with it.  Battry backup good, but you have to plug charger while playing games.Lappy has 2 speakers & sound quality also good. The major point is, I can upgrade storage with SSD slot it means hdd+SSD.
"
"Look is very stylish. Battery backup is awesome.
"
"Overall it is a good laptop for daily use and little bit gaming and editing.....but you can't expect hard-core performance from it..... I do not like the display of this laptop and the performance is also ok ok.....for 55k-56k it is a decent one.....if it is your first laptop then you will not be disappointed.
"
"after using 3 months i am giving this review it has good battery backup from 4-5 hours on a single charge on normal use it is has a good hardware configuration and proccesor performance is very fast as comapred with i5 7 genoveroll good product to buy
"
"Not Soo much good just okOk at this price u can go with other one better
"
"I hv been using the laptop for 3months now... in this time period... i hv not found any major dispute yet... Its battery life is awesome... Sound quality is also good... I am using AutoCad, FL Studios like software... and hv been playing games like FIFA, PUBG Lite, NFS... So in my opinion U can go for this Lappy surely...##a small tip in a small review...***just never forget to update ur system***""for gaming"" ""sound quality"" ""value for money"" ""battery performance""

"Not for gaming mx110 is entry level graphic card so please Gamers don't buy
"
"For light it is perfect and for professional use it is best
"
"The laptop is smooth and fast owing to the SSD. Couple of disappointments1. No Backlit keyboard - Amazon does not mention it but the responses I received did mention a backlit keyboard. I suppose it was the seller. Hope Amazon had better mechanism around it.2. No 5G wireless - At this price point, it is quite surprising that the wifi adapter provided does not support 5Ghz as it is a single band wifi adapter. Thats a big bummer for me. Again hope that this information was mentioned by Amazon in the product description.Rest the performance is good so far. Good battery life and performance.
"
"Good configuration in this price
"
"Good laptop... i5 8th gen 1tb+256gb ssd it's  work nice. Fingers print scanner  is accurate..
"
"It's very good laptop.Perfomance is very nice and powerfull.
"
"It's a nice Laptop with great performance. I'm quite satisfied with the performance of the product.
"
"Not happy
"
"After doing so much research, I decided to buy this product.Process of reboot is very fast because of 256 GB SSD drive. You get additional 1 TB HDD for media storage.The Display is full HD narrow bezel, so the screen looks wider.Sound quality is good. Fingerprint is very useful.Only thing I am missing is Backlit keyboard. In pavilion models, it is available but they are very costly.Its weight is approx 2 Kg, Design is very good. I mostly work on Excel so full size keyboard is useful for me.Battery backup is 6 hrs which is good.I would have loved to give it 5 stars but I am giving 1 star less because Amazon sent me an Invoice with wrong Serial number. For almost 1 month I was calling them regularly. Amazon refused to change their invoice due to some technical reasons & gave me seller's contact number. Finally I managed to get the correct Invoice from the seller. Seller was customer friendly & co-operative. He immediately sent me the correct invoice.But I am very disappointed with Amazon's customer service. The product is amazon fulfilled, still I had to call them again & again. I will never forget the harassment I faced in this 1 month. We buy products online because we get huge discounts, but these are the technical problems we can get. Plus we don't get any accessories also.So the product is very good for personal use, 5 Star for the product. 1 Star for Amazon's Customer service.
"
"Junk Laptop. The battery does not even get charged
"
"Some scratch will be found on body but good condition
"
"Always need to video shoot before opening package products...HP laptop not in packaging only charger received...zero value after paying full money... Laptop not packaged for charging to check battery life.... And completely laptop weight is missed ....too sad
"
"Very good laptop @ 22k. Right enough for a college student with decent performance. Little slow with 4GB memory. Pre installed Windows 10 Home & MS Office. But, office needs to bought separately & just use the MS account & no installation needed to use office products. Nice screen & nice looking laptop & go for it, no issues.
"
"Plz don't buy dis laptop it's not worth for 22k not so good to use its just for show off not a good product to sell in Amazon Very disappointed
"
"it is a 3rd grade laptop which cannot open ms excel and takes its own time. Too slow for any operations. This laptop reminded me of 2002 when i used to study on school PC for my 2nd standard classs. Maybe it is more slower then that school PC.
"
"Just completed only 30days..not much rough use.. Product now is not getting on.. Very bad productVery bad product and very bad service..I strongly recommend no one to buy this
"
"The HP 15 db0209au 15.6-inch Laptop (A4-9125/4GB/1TB/Windows 10/Integrated Graphics), Jet Black  is good for basic , moderate use.The description say it comes with anti-glare screen, but actually it doesn't have anti-glare screen.Its very slow, it takes a long time to open simple things like file explorer, MS Word, etc as Pre-installed Windows 10 is extremely slow.Not at all good for heavy games. But one can play light weight games.Microsoft applications like Word, etc ask for Product Key for activation which is not provided. So one might have to reinstall Microsoft office.Rest, the laptop is very light weight, quite sturdy n good looking with good keypad panel and touch pad.But this is what u can get at this price (bought at Rs.20,000/-)(P.S: One may try re-installing Windows10 or any other version to make the system run smoothly)

"One of the best laptop in this price range . After compared with many other brnads in same range i choose HP for its brand value ..Full hd diplay core i5 8th generation 8gb ram , 1tb hdd , i installed ssd hdd in dvd compartment . So laptop is performing very good .Information for new buyers there is a m.2 ssd slot inside (pic attached)  so you can use both drive 1tb inbuilt and use 1 m.2 ssd also .The viewing angles are not great . But ok .Sound quality is good.Both graphics option availble to choose between on board intel graphics and Nvidia mx110.Battery life i m getting approx 3 hrBest part is weight of this lappy .. 1.77 kg only. And its not very thick . Its sleek.For gaming please go for mx150 graphics card option as this one has mx110 only .
"
"I had ordered this HP laptop because of its low price according to this specifications and brand name HP.But after receiving this product, I had to face lots of issues, as it came with DOS version, so I installed the Windows 10 1809 ( latest version as of now) and whenever I try to charge this laptop while laptop is running I got a battery error notification ""Plugged in not charging"".I had to call HP support center first, they gave some solutions but none worked, they even asked me to downgrade the windows so I Installed Windows 10 1803 but that also didn't worked, so I thought may be replacing the laptop would fix it, but again in replaced laptop ( second laptop ) I got the same battery issue.So returned this product and I went for ASUS laptop (i5 8th gen/8gb, without graphics) which is running better, I already own few other laptops of ACER and Toshiba but never faced such an issue in new laptop. I also ordered ACER laptop with DOS i5 ( 7th gen ) 1.5 years back which is still working goodI have got the refund amount but this HP laptop is headache, think 1000 times before buying this.
"
"Laptop is gud but when i purchase i dont know that hp hardware does not support windows 7/8 . I love windows 7 but hp forces me use to windows 10 because usb drivers not working. third party drivers i installed but hp gives us some more features that not working in windows 7/8 but dont worry product is okay. and fan noise is low to figured it out either its on or off.today 26 may now its work perfectly I used mostly software like blender etc. machine is powerfull at that price. it is only negative point is video memory when you use heavy 3d software. only when this machine lag so much otherwise it working properly.I never played a single game in this machine.I think this will helps you a lot.
"
"I got it from Amazon at a good affordable price. The product arrived my address a day before the suggested dates and the shipment was easy to track using proper ID. The product has a good sound quality however it is not as loud as  expected. It's average battery life is 4 to 7 hrs  depending on the usage. Overall it was a better experience. Thank u amazon.
"
"Laptop is all good at this price rangeNo heating issue or lagsSome will say Nvidia mx110 is not great for gaming but it is capable of running GTA5 at very high settings 60fps I have tried myself!Don't expect battery life like a fool if you play heavy games on the machine!It even runs PUBG at medium settings 40-60fps!It is a highly upgradeable budget gaming laptopUpdate:After 23 daysBattery life is great considered gaming apmost 2 hrs on games like far cry 5Also it runs far cry 4 ultra settingsFar cry 5and 6 on high settingsQuantom Break on medium settingsBattlefield 5 on high settingsBattlefield 1 on highest settingsSo far no issues

"Am already having an HP i3 pavillion which is doing a great job till now. That's the only reason for me to purchase another laptop of i5 series when I think for an upgrade. I just got a fresher review only as this is too early for a review. Still the first impression I get from my laptop is good. Nice display, a bit more faster and good.

"
"This product may be very good but please make sure you read all details carefully before buying it. It's showing RS 8000 cheaper than original price because it doesn't have any operating system so you have to buy operating system separately. I can't give any star rating as my laptop doesn't started because of missing OS. And worst part is that it's not returnable. Only replacement option is there.

"Sound quality was great.Battery life is average.And value of money
"
"I bought the Windows 10 + Office + 256 GB SSD at less than 41k after Rs. 7.3k for old laptop + Rs. 1500 instant cashback HDFC offer and 6 months No Cost EMI (Rs. 6860 per month). I am convinced you cannot get this configuration at a better price.  Sound quality is great. Full HD is awesome (for movies and videos).  I am not a gamer, so I am unable to comment on suitability for gaming.  Boots is under 5 secs due to SSD. According to benchmark websites, an i5 8th Gen is almost as good as i7 8th Gen in terms of performance, so it meets my requirements (Programming, multi-tasking etc).  Free MS Office and Windows 10 lifetime.  It has a DVD Writer too. It has 8GB RAM and you can add 8 GB more after you receive it. It has an additional M2 slot in which you can add another SSD - no need to remove the DVD writer. I still cannot believe I got all of this in 41k. What are you waiting for?
"
"This product has the feature of 256 GB Solid State Drive, 1 TB Hard Drive, 8GB RAM, etc..When I have received the laptop, I see the laptop does not have 1 TB hard drive which gives me a complete shock. I see only 238 GB SSD where the OS is installed. I am extremely disappointed that the hard drive is missing.I have checked the My computer, bios setting, disk management. Even the hard drive information shows only the 238GB SSD is available but no 1TB Hard Drive.I have reached out to amazon support. I am not sure when they will fix this. Worst delivery from Amazon ever.

"The keyboard number key came out just after 3days .and this is not covered under warranty .

"HP, Dell and Lenova are top three market leader in Laptop for last many years. After lot of study and referring lot of online review, I finally selected HP i5 8th generation , 8 GB RAM, (15q-ds1000TU ) laptop with inbuilt windows 10 and MS office (pre-installed). Also selected SSD (256GB) for fast boot up. As per past feedback, normal HDD gives more boot up time for Windows 10 while boot up is very for fast for SSD. It takes vary few seconds. However cost of laptop due to SSD is slight higher. Only small drawback is that SDD is 256 GB while HDD normally 1 TB capacity. However external hard disk can be connected with SDD if required.HP Laptop 15.6 inch full HD screen is very good. MS office licence version is preinstalled i.e. no trial version and no need to purchase extra. It is very good and its price of MS office and Windows 10 is already included.DVD drive is also provided.This laptop is very good for normal day to day jobs, coding for engineering college student.Quality of this HP Laptop is very good. Overall value for money. My rating is 5 star.
"
"When I decided to buy this laptop I was worried about the negative comments but after using it for a month I feel like I took a good decision. I brought the 320 GB SSD version and it's quite fast. Till now I haven't faced any problem. Battery life is quite acceptable and goes up to on an average 4-5 hours. Speaker is clear. The webcam is also on a positive side. But what I fell the inbuilt keyboard will get damage soon. The quality of the inbuilt keyboard is extremely low. Overall I will say its a good product with in the price range but yes don't expect for a miracle with this laptop.
"
"Hi everyone I just bought this laptop...It's a little heavy as it seems but build quality is decent enough.But yeah keyboard is beauty cz of good travel and clicky buttons...Speakers are decent but not mind blowing..Screen is good and bright enough..Thanks to Amazon for good delivery..Thank you for that..That's my opinion about this fast laptop..
"
"I have been using this laptop for about a month. This is value for money. I did not get any other laptop with SSD in this range. Looking at the price I was doubtful about the quality. Though plastic quality is not premium, it functions as expected. Boots up in less than a minute and ready to work as soon as you logon. I've worked on numerous laptops before for office and personal use, but this one is on par with my office laptop worth 80K (that is also same config but premium).Pro:- Price, performance, has DVD drive, anti-glare screen, battery (4-5hours)Cons - Feels bulky, No backlit keys, Keyboard quality is average, Touch-pad buttons bit hard,If you are not carrying it around more and simply use at one place this laptop is good for you. It came with MS Office which is added advantage.
"
"Very good battery life for all day. Fast charging. My business with amazon and others website. All day my laptop is on  and do all day working on this. That's why i said about battery. SSD give power boost. Super fast laptop. numeric keywords. Good Sound. Used by last 4 months with no issue. Original windows & office gives more easily work. i5 processor with 8th generation. I don't know why people gives 3 star. I give 5 star rating with best honest reasons after 4 month.
"
"I thought I would upgrade from i3 to i5 with SSD when my current Dell Inspiron malfunctioned.  There are multiple I5 models from different brands like Lenovo, Dell and even Asus but HP is the least costliest. I have chosen HP apprehensively, but I am pleaseantly flabbergasted at the price band, 45K, and overall performance of this laptop.  Apart from price, the delivery was also done quickly within a day, and the laptop is loaded with windows and Microsoft applications. To talk about performance, the laptop boots in just over 3 sec and is quite capable of running fairly complex programs. For instance, I have deployed python and SQL on the laptop and code gets executed without any lag.  The speed comes mainly from SSD which gives performance on par with i7. In terms of disadvantages, the laptop could have been better interms of display quality as youtube videos look bit dim at times but it's speed and build quality makes up for the minor flaws. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a laptop for doing a bit of complex coding to daily usage.
"
"Very good laptop. Super fast bootung. Now slowness. No performance issue. Best for programmers and daily use.Gaming experience not tested.Good battery life.Good build quality. So many times this thing has fallen down.But no damages till. No much negatives except the mat display which personally i don't like much.And getting windows 10 with office basic is a plus. If you are going to purchase with lesser priced linux / DOS system of same configuration, I would suggest to rethink that decision as your time is again lost on installation and other stuff..Overall good and getting an ssd in this price range is too awesome.Worth buying and would suggest to anybody.
"

This laptop becomes demonic with Windows 10 OS a buggy and non user friendly Windows. I personally recommend you not to by this product. If you still wish to, ask the vendor to supply one with Windows 7.  This laptop is the real hell with Windows 10.

Not yet lagged(in 15 day usage). Display n its quality is average. Keyboard is fine. Not recommended for gaming and heavy users. Ssd is working best(the only benchmark I found).Overall it's a decent laptop with decent looks and specs. Nothing too good or exceptional about this laptop.

"
"This laptop is terrible. When i charge the battery,  it becomes extremely hot & the back panel becomes too hot. The design itself is wrong. The exhaust fan is built above the speaker. Therefore,  the speaker panel becomes too hot after using for sometime. I know Amazon will not agree if i want to return the product. I regret wasting my Rs. 50,000 for this crap.

"Value for money..
"
"The laptop is really good, except the keyboard when lit, some of the keys are not visible properly due to thin letter prints and the light could not pass through. I wonder how HP released it to market without testing this.

"Bought this recently from a HP store at Rs. 58500. At this price this is a good choice feature wise. It's like an all-rounder, not lacking too much in any specific area. I have used it only for few days. So far no problem; working smoothly.

"Prices are much high as compared to other laptops with same configuration.Most importantly it is hanging frequently. Amazon customer care responses after purchasing is worst.
"
"I got this product as it was the perfect deal - A good price of 36k , and the flexibility to be upgraded.I purchased a WD 240GB SSD, and a Kingston 8GB DDR4 RAM as well, for a combined price of 5500.Although it seemed risky to ""unscrew and open"" up my laptop on the day of purchase itself, I don't regret it now.After removing the optical drive, and replacing the caddy with the supplied HDD, and installing the SSD in the original HDD slot - I cloned the OS to the SSD.Now I have a blazing fast laptop with i5 , 12GB RAM , 240GB SSD + 1TB HDD for a combined price of Rs. 41000.The best experience indeed :)

The powerful 10th gen intel core i3 processor combined with a ssd makes this laptop smoother and faster which can make every work possible. The 360 degree rotating hinge makes this a convertible laptop which can also work as tablet!

"Light weight ,good battery backup , it can be expandable to 16gb RAM. Slim design
"
"Honestly, with the kind of specs and for it's price, it could have been better. It works like a mediocre laptop with normal specifications. Also PUBG mobile runs on the lowest resolution on this laptop.  If it can't run this game smoothly, I don't know about the rest of it. But it has pretty decent features. Not everything is disappointing about it, like the keyboard is super smooth along with the resolution. Also it's lightweight and the speakers are good.

"Complete plastic construction, delicate laptop,light weight.AMD graphics will give you trouble with Windows 10. Graphic drivers and windows 10 both are tall claims and low on delivery.3 big companies have lied together to bring out this cheap assembly (AMD,Microsoft, HP). My review is 3 star only because it is sold with DOS. and I am not sure if some one will use DOS in 2018 on laptops.If you have expert or time to patiently research yourself, you may succeed overcoming the display going blank.It will work well with Display chip disabled fully, hence dedicated graphics feature to be  subtracted from the spec.6-8Hr battery back up to be ready as 3 hours max, with fans turned off. Another lie.Frequent price drop is justifiable, it is worth about 18-200000 Rs range.Day 8 addition - with defective graphics driver or hardware projecting your screen on a TV or projector is ruled out. Making it a use less office laptop too.Day 330 - Key board gone, warranty expired already. When bought 6month warranty was still available, but took a chance base on HP brand.Write off.
"
"Working on a laptop has become a nightmare ever since I have started working on HP 245 G6 laptop. The operating system I am using windows 10 64 bit and frankly speaking, its too slow to work simultaneously on different application. The hard part is only windows 10 64 bit drivers are available on the HP's support page; meaning you cannot run any other operating system (windows 7 or windows 8).Waiting for refund.
"
"Performance wise laptop is good ..... almost similar performance my Fujitsu i3 (5th Gen) Laptop.But it's body material seem little cheap .... In nutshell, best laptop for under 20k.
"
"Even though I got a dead pixel on the screen, Its totally worth it. Can't go through the pathetic replacement procedure, so keeping it. It's pretty small and compact.Installed Windows 10 and everything works fine. AMD display driver can be found on HP product website. It works better than the the one you get from Windso update. Also it doesn't have optical drive.(Not like we need it). 4GB ram does the job. 1TB storage is enough for average user. Amazing battery life with normal usage.
"
"Screen in anti-glare which is important for laptops. The keyboard is smooth.It does not have an DVD drive, but neither does it have any port to install an off-market drive or a SSD in a SATA caddy. I was hoping that it would have a dummy DVD drive with a working sata port, but it doesn't even have a port or slot to install an SSD. You have to remove the HDD and exchange it for an SSD to boost the performance.I've been using HP 245s for over 3 years including g4 and g5 and they are working flawlessly for years. I own 5 of these.As a maintenance measure to vacuum clean the old laptop, i took it apart and found absolutely no dust inside. It is well designed to prevent dust from entering the laptop.

"I brought this laptop by seeing its excellent spec. AMD 9 3GGHz 4GB etc..This laptop is working fine with ubuntu. No issues. But when it comes to windows(win 10 64bit) , it starts hanging and showing blue screen error frequently. Initially there was no problem at all. Every issue started when i started installing device drivers. At some point of time it starts hanging. I realized that this was due to a device driver conflict and i identified that the problem is being created by the graphics driver. Every time the screen refreshes heavily (Window Maximize, Minimize some thing like that) the system hangs and goes to blue screen error. For the first 2 days i searched for solutions(Including i installed Win8.1,Win 7, downloading original drivers from HP site,surfing videos related to this issue). But no use, the issue persist.Then i opted returnExcellent Support by Amazon: This is where I am lucky, Amazon support was great and quick. They gave me an option  for replacement and later amazon informed that the replacement cannot be done , and so the full amount was refunded with in 2 days after the receipt of the returned item.Vedict: I dont believe this is a single piece defect. This is something related to graphics driver software/Hardware series . Ubutntu is fine. But windows is hanging every time

"Quick Questions:-Ram: 4GB DDR4 (Max 16 Gb Supported tested personally)OS: Windows 10 ( Lower Versions won't work due to driver compatibility)1) In Windows 10 main problem of this laptop is AMD Graphics driver which causes blue/white screen error with system restart/crashQuick  Fix for this :1) Update the bios first from hp support website2) Do not use AMD driver from AMD or HP website it won't work and cause same problems just Download Windows 10 (1083 or later version) then only install the Wireless/Lan driver so you can connect internet then just run Windows Update and almost 2 GB files gonnna be downloaded and then restart the pc and wait till update completes . Once updated you can see AMD graphic driver automatically installed and no issues but don't stop here go to Device Manager and Choose the AMD readon graphics driver and click Update it will again download and update  . Thats all  now no more driver conflict issue and no auto crash for Graphics .2)  Realtec Sound not working or Mp3 not playing in Media Player or VLC this problem is very easy to fix just download the old Realtec audio driver from support website and berore installing remove the previous audio driver then after installation just disable audio enhancements that's all problem fixed.3) Start Menu not working after installation of Corel draw or Other software : This problem has nothing ti do with SFC scannow because that won't work just go to registry editor and give all user access to all packages and restart thats all no more start menu issue.

"Bought this offline for 25K(backpack and other freebies included). It is a very good product. It has optical drive.Pros:1. Crisp display. 14""2. Keys are awesome and island style. Nice feel and travel length.3. Battery backup is awesome. Without battery saver you get 4hrs + on time.4. Better go for windows 10. It has all it's drivers in HP website.5. Minimal heating.6. Better than i3.7. Ram is DDR4.Cons:1. Viewing angles are bad. But hey, consider the price too.2. No usb 3.0 port. Three usb 2.0 ports available.Go for it if you have slightly more budget than that of HP245 g5. Also it has Matt finish and looks definitely better than g5.Thank you.

"Hello, I really liked the laptop, I purchased it from the seller ""Binary Computers"". But after installing Windows OS and HP support software , I realized that three months of warranty is already gone. When I contacted HP regarding the same with my invoice. They said that the invoice provided by Amazon is not a valid one. I am stuck without warranty, No help from Amazon, or HP. Now stuck with a warranty-less laptop.

"Very good product with decent look. I was using core i3 series laptop but o/s installation in this system took lesser time than i3 system.Pros:1.

"Laptop with Full Year Warranty and Brand New! After getting the laptop. Received after 4 to 5 business days. Had it shipped from Punjab to Kerala. It was factory sealed. Please install drivers from the support website and also install HP support assist.

"Performance is very good considering it's price. Despite having a slow HDD, it boots very fast. Battery life is user dependent and with my usage of only surfing web, it lasts about 4-5Hrs. Display is a cheap quality panel but considering it's price it's right. It's very light weight and sturdy in nature. Most useful feature is having a large variety of I/O port and a RJ45 port which nowadays gone missing from laptop.PS - I'll suggest every potential buyers and owners of this laptop to upgrade to a SSD, it'll improve battery life and system will also be much faster.

"I have purchased the product , as skeptical, as this was a product with a new processor and I wanted to use it with LINUX operating system. I  had browsed the net and found that there were initial teething problems  and was apprehensive,  however I have installed the ARCH LINUX and though have to carry on with installing the full graphical environment, I had checked on the live bootable version, it seems to be working.  I have to still delve deeper and get the most from this CPU.  NO heating problems, Battery life seems to be good, however a thourough check will need to be done. wifi good, bluetooth to be tested. Sound reasonable. What more would you want.  Yes the case gets smeared by finger prints, ASUS case is far better.
"
"Product is good.. But faced an issue refarding display and  you cant update warranty on hp website.. As they told that seller is unauthorized so we cant update warranty details... So beware of this....Conclusion dont buy this laptop... As you will surely face issues regarding warranty for this...No support from amazon and hp side.....
"
"Definitely faster than slightly the more expensive laptops with intel i3 processors. At just over 1.5 kgs, very portable. High performance interior in a cheaper looking exterior !Warranty is not a concern. Mine had 10 months of manufactures warranty left, according to the HP website. If you call HP support with the original invoice having the serial number, this will be resolved. If your invoice doesn't have the serial number, you have to ask Amazon and the seller to add it in the invoice. Only then it's valid.
"
"The starting temperature in this laptop is over 120°F at idle mode.. Gets super heated and the heat exhaust is near the screen which makes the screen also very heated.. Highly not recommending this..

"i bought this from the seller, ""since 2012"". yes thats the name of the seller, during the amazon festive sale. the price was lowest during the sale, 21599/- further 2000/- off from sbi. i was skeptical on purchasing the laptop from this seller as it had on 3 ratings but i went ahead. amazing product from hp for daily use although supports drivers for windows 10 only. yes u can install other windows but u wont get audio, lan or display drivers.i am unsatisfied with the packaging amazon provided. when we purchase any electronic item worth 20k, amazon should provide good packaging rather than a pathetic one.

"Using for last couple of weeks. If you install windows, you need to have RAM upgraded to 8G / 12G /add ssd as once you install antivirus, it gets pretty slow n memory n disk utilization is mostly above 90%.

"No freedom to install windows 7 hate it.. having been using from 1 month it's a good laptop with good battery and good processor.. but had to forcefully install windows 10 and activate it. There is no option at all as biso does not allow u to install windows 7 and no drivers available. Even once u install windows 10 the drivers for it are pathetic ESP the display not worth given its a amd processor and graphics.

"Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn't play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed & higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (""HP assistant"" is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don't bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop & my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.

"I was looking for a laptop that is:1. Two in one Laptop plus tablet that is 360 degree foldable but not detachable  and comes with a free pen2. Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don't do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it's okay, you don't get everything at this price point.  It's about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a 'cool' look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)

"With premium fit and finish to go with all the features mentioned, this model is a good combination of both form and functionality. The only grouse was that there was some lag initially while booting up, but that seems to have gone away on its own now. Also, it's only been a few weeks since I've been using it, so I can't speak for its durability. This particular piece is a replacement piece - the original one that was delivered refused to start! So am a little worried - my experience with HP products has been great in the past, so let's hope this one also continues to reinforce that.Also, Get 10% cb and 6 months extended warranty by ordering through wplov .in/63

"I bought this product in a hurry during Diwali time and I regret almost daily. Below are a few but most critical issues I have faced ever since I bought this laptop1) Extremely slow and loading takes hell lot of time2) Though manual update is enabled system goes for auto windows update in every 2 days time. Updates runs for 6/7 hours which means you never get time to use the laptop3) No matter how many times you run shut down command the laptop continues to be on unless you physically shut it down4) can't even open 4 Window tabs simultaneously as it crashes5) Overall nice looking fancy gadget without any practical utilities..Extremely disappointing and hope I can get it replaced.
"
" This laptop has an SSHD for boot up , so ideally it should be fast and smooth but sadly that is not at all the case , the apps crash and the laptop lags and becomes irresponsive as soon as you shift to tablet mode also it has a problem of over heating. All in all the performance is highly dissatisfactory. I have a Macbookpro that i bought in 2014 and even that works better than the new HP x360 that i got. Also , even after constant attempts Amazon has not yet helped me getting a refund or even a replacement for the product.
"
"Bought it less than 10 days ago. Got a faulty product. Very slow and hanging always. Overheating too in 5 min. Very disappointed with HP and Amazon. Need replacement!

"Have been using this laptop for the last 3 months and the issues seem to never end. It looks good, feels good and there ends the matter. I am already facing issues with the audio, the company claims it to be a software update issue. The heat sink stopped working and it's been more than 15 days since the complaint has been raised yet they have to replace the part not sure of they are yet to manufacturer it. Pathetic after sales service. The laptop is slower than a P1 system. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Will update this review once the part is replaced to see if it improves the performance.
"
"This is an awesome laptop. It has premium look. And as some review mentioned it is a bit slow with 4 GB ram but once you upgrade it to 8GB it runs smoothly without any single lag. After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe's light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn't actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it's deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.

"Serial No. on the invoice is different from the serial no printed on the machine and on the machine packing box. HP is unwilling to undertake return and exchange of a product with several faults which they admitted in writing they are going to replace but due to this fraudulent invoice they cannot. RAM is 2666 Hz inside machine whereas website specifies 2400, so I cant upgrade RAM. Speakers are faulty. HP Admits these faults and has given DOA for exchange approval but without invoice having proper serial no. it cannot. Dealer has definitely thus planned a fraud cleverly. Police Complaint is the only solution left, since Amazon helpline robots are speaking product cannot be returned to amazon.

"First of all, Great team work by the vendor and Amazon to deliver my laptop within 24 hours.  Great and easy to set up.  Pristine condition, Great sound, butter smooth touch screen response, nice back lit keyboard, absolutely silent processor and fan.  Total Value for money....

"Screen is very thin and not stable, you can't work in a moving vehicle or car.Worst laptop, not useful only fancy.

"The device arrived in just 2 days. So good delivery time. The startup was smooth and the pen provided works nicely. The touch was a bit awry(it just worked in bottom right of screen and didn't recognize touch on rest of the screen) the first time but after installing the BIOS update from the hp support manager application, this also gives you the warranty for the device, everything works smooth. The performance is good for standard home use. The ddr4 2400mhz ram does speed things up. The Hard drive is a sshd so boot times are fast.The problem with the windows 10 is bloat ware. I would suggest disabling the needless background services and advertising and suggestion features also Cortana. They typically start to eat away at the disk usage and processor usage.The processor itself handles things pretty well. I tried the pen with krita a drawing program. It worked fine. Just fine. It has pressure sensitivity, and the input lag is ok. However for serious drawing I would prefer something else. Even so this device has good pen support. Just enable the ""disable touch when using pen"" feature in windows 10 setting. That should prevent any spurious touch input.For internet I  prefer  Mozilla because it is a little less ram intensive than chrome. So everything works aptly fast.However don't expect to run games smoothly as the video ram is shared. Even though it can handle simple games like asphalt 8 from Microsoft store well enough.The added benefit is the office 2016 home & student.You get word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. All work smoothly and without any lag.All in all, a good device for daily usage. Battery lasts around 6 to 7 hours with internet usage and background programs running. With brightness set to around 40 percent.

"Purchased the laptop 1 month ago. So far:Good/Impressives:1.) Great experience with the system. No hang, or slowness in performance2.) Soft keyboard with broader keys, helps elderly and the young. The key press is very smooth and almost silent.3.) The touch screen is very fast and responsive and you can use it freely without hiccups.4.) The battery life is decent with a full charge lasting about 4.5 hrs. Charging is also quite fast and usually charges in about 1.5 hrs to a decent level.5.) As it is a HDD system, it does take a little time to boot.6.) Look and finish is quite decent and also received a few words of appreciation on my selection ! :)7.) Comes with the digital Window Ink Pen, which is also quite impressive with its performance. You can use it in multiple ways, to sketch, make sticky notes and reminder, etc.8.) It is a dual core system and the processing is quite decent, though the system struggles with a large data set, macros, etc.9.) Has a 1 TB HDD storage which is quite huge and you can store loads of your data. Word of caution: Do have the habit of backing up the data, as if the system goes down, you might land up losing a god amount of data.Less Impressive:1.) This is a Win 10 system, and so could have done with a 8GB RAM. A 4GB RAM, may not last long and so might sound a little less impressive for the price.2.) Having a touchscreen option, I am not sure if the screen is scratch resistant or not. Could not find much details on it even on the internet.3.) System is a dual core, and so processing slows down for medium to larger data set, or macros.4.) The laptop could have made good with some more connectivity options as it does not have an Optical Disc Drive. There are only 2 USB ports (Though 1 is a USB 3.1 port), 1 HDMI port, 1 Gen 2 Type C port. This makes the user purchase an external multi connectivity Type C adapter, costing about Rs. 8000/-5.) The laptop has a dedicated volume control on the right side. This is a laptop and the available volume control keys very well serve the purpose. The Additional Volume keys seem redundant. Instead, a finger print sensor could have add more value to the product for the price and could have become a much stronger product pitch.Apart from this there is the standard 1 year domestic warranty for manufacturing defects/deficiencies.Conclusion: Overall, the product is quite decent purchase, but given to the lack of a finger print sensor, it gives users way to check out other options like Lenovo, Asus, etc. If you are not a very strong user of laptops or if you have very less amount of technical, coding stuff to do, then, this can be a good choice to go with.Thanks and hope this is helpful

"Writing review after around 1 year usage:- Very very slow performance, I added 8GB additional RAM helped to improve the performance to little better.- Touch is not consistent, cursor jumps from one place to another without any user action.-  Display screen is detaching from lid: As we open the Lid holding right top corner, left down corner display is coming out.- System Restarts: I have a Smart watch that has a charger with Magnet internally, once I brought it closer to laptop to connect the USB Port. System Restarted.Not worth for this money, HP should improve their quality. I some other use cases (too technical to explain it here) where this system is failing.
"
"The Laptop look is very good. Touchscreen and all other features are elegant. BUT THE LAPTOP IS HORRIBLY SLOW. Shedding out 50000 for such a slow LAPTOP is awful. I still have one Compaq Presario CQ40 8 yrs OLD... which is 100 times faster than this laptop. I use MAC Air, which is Undoubtedly the superfast of the lot...ONLY NEGATIVE SIDE OF THIS LAPTOP is that THIS is AWFULLY SLOW... I work very fast. Feeling like returning the same. BUT NO OPTIONS. Feeling like trapped now.
"
"I bought this mainly for my travel and trek tours. To manage my finances and investment and communication when on travel.Great product but a little slow. Did not bother me much because I do not use it to play video games. Moreover it comes with Windows 10, Basic Office, tablet mode and touch screen.I reduced a star because it is bit slow. If HP has any suggestions to make it faster like even adding additional hardware, I would be happy to do it.
"
"A lot of glitches! The screen freezes a lot. It stops sensing the touch no matter how much you try! Demands 'Restart' over and over again. Waste of money! And really pathetic battery performance... It goes 30 to 21 within 10 minutes!!!
"
"This is a very slow laptop - will test your patience and ive already lost my patience few times. Takes a while to load, runs some sort of covert operation in the backend all the time consuming the entire 4GB of ram.Keyboard too has stopped functioning smoothly, requiring one to key in multiple timesFancy looking and serves no practical use!
"
"I bought this laptop many months back. There are so many pros for this laptop like lightweight machine, touchscreen, Genuine OS and Office, build quality, SSHD(Remember..its not SSD). The performance of the laptop was just average until i upgraded this laptop with an additional 4GB RAM (Kingston) and 250GB SSD(Samsung EVO860). The performance of the laptop improved drastically thereafter.
"
"Laptop was really nice. No hanging no lagging or anything. At first instance I hesitated to buy the product through online but after I bought it I was fully satisfied it is really awesome. Packing was great and ontime delivery. One small thing I didn't like is inking pen it is normal not up to the mark. Rest everything is perfect.
"
"The product is good so far but had major issues with Wifi on windows 10. The Wi-Fi would disconnect very frequently and I tried multiple options as per windows 10 support website but none of them worked. finally I went to HP website and they suggested to reinstall windows and that’s what I did from within windows 10 setup on this laptop. and that solved the problem of Wi-Fi  connectivity. But this cost me many weeks hope this feedback helps people
"
"Worst product i ever used.It's been 16 days since I bought this and 3 time some technicians have come and done the troubleshooting.  Yet even today I face same problems.  Not even a single file (pdf, word, excel etc) or app will open in less than 3/4 mins. I have asked for a refund.  But since Amazon doesn't deal with refunds I'm held up very badly with this.  And they have assured to replace with new one without these issues.
"
"Pros:Stylish & TrendySmooth touch responseBrilliant screenCons:Bit slower (might be due to SSHDD)Poor Battery 🔋, only upto 2-3 hrs.No finger print sensor
"
"I wish to give a zero star! This looks to be refurbished one or rejected one from HP factory. I cannot do anything for first 10 ten minutes from switching on, HP is reluctant to attend to the issues, ultimately buyers are fooled. Amazon, the seller and HP has done a great job.
"
"We had received a defective piece. By the time the complaint raised was resolved online, the return period expired. We had to then take it to a service centre. There was problem with the screen, the touchscreen didn’t work. The issue was resolved, but it was an altogether bad experience. Just learnt a valuable lesson - do not buy such costly products online as you may be handed a defective piece.
"
"This is okay. Not great. Go for a better variant which can be faster. I3 and 4 gb Ram, not worth it.
"
"High price for SSHD..! I thought it was SSD alone..! Heats up after 10 minutes of use and fan sound becomes heavy..! I tried to work on some Mechanical CAD Design softwares the performance was very poor..! The system is way too slow, may be an issue with 100% disk usage. But HP and windows 10 is a deadly combination. You don't want to buy this. Only advantage is its portability.Update after six months of use: Keyboard back light went off while using and never turned on again. Quality is very poor. Also I bought it on Jan 2019, but the warranty shown is from August 2018. I guess the seller Appario Ltd sold a poor quality laptop which was returned by someone or some renewed product. I was initially suspicious about their low quality packaging. There was no company cover for this product. I suggest not to buy this kind of costly electronics online as they can fraud you easily. We never know whether its new or renewed.
"
"I bought this product on 5th May 2019 as a gift and after opening the package and getting all the updates done, the laptop was very slow to open a simple word doc or any other applications, there was not even programmes installed but still the machine was slow. I had 10days to return the product but since it was a gift for my wife I was not using this machine and the 10 day period passed by, afterwards I contacted Amazon and they said I cant return the laptopn as the 10 days period has passed but they can replace the machine (which they did) and the same problem persists but I cant to do anything about it so its lying on my table gathering dust (I did order a sleeve so dust is not gathering), secondly the warranty was suppose to be for 12 months but when I registered it on HP website it said 8 months, I tried contacting HP and they reverted back by saying they will fix it but that has not changed now its says 7 months warranty remains. Even the amazon tech guy who visited my place said this model has the problem of lagging and it cant be fixed. Very disappointed with this HP product esp. since all my other laptops and printer are HP.
"
"Pathetic is the best word to describe the product. I don't understand how HP sells such laptops. Its as good as a paperweight as you can't do anything much other than that. You can't open a single application or a file / photo as it takes forever to do any of this. It looks like the i3 processor and 4gb memory is grossly insufficient for this OS. Even start menu doesn't open (if you click on windows logo on the left corner of task bar absolutely nothing happens. It doesn't open with dedicated windows key on keyboard too). So you simply can't shutdown and the only way to do is to long press the power button and do a force shutdown. Then why is HP selling such laptops shooting on its own foot. Looks like it is only to have lower priced laptops in highly competitive market place where there are second rank players who give better configured laptops at same price point. All those who think brand means quality, this is a wake up call to not be so naive any longer. Those good old days have gone and today what matters is how you can make money and you can do ANYTHING to achieve that.

"Laptop look is very good but it's lagging when I am running you tube videos and it's taking time approx 1 minute to open Google chrome properly. So that I want to replace this item now.

"Okay so I’ll be very honest with my review! Note: This is my personal experience wanted to write about this product for future buyers!Got pavilion 360 i3 1tb ddr4 , Wanted a good laptop for my niece, basically for a school kid. this is a beautiful looking laptop amazing screen display and the ‘360’ thing! Now what all I disliked about this product is this processor is not recommended for people who wish to do multitasking. IT IS A SLOW LAPTOP! it lags. YES IT DOES. I’ll be harsh at this point. I hope my comment amazon does not delete! But literally taking my time out and writing this for you guys ,wanted to share with someone out there who is willing to spend that much amount On a device. You can’t do heavy softwares easily on this device (eg photoshop,illustrator). It will work brilliant AGAIN BRILLIANT if you’re just looking for web browsing, watching movies, Netflix, documenting, making presentations etc.Battery life is good.Touchscreen is also good. Responsive. Sometimes lags when you fold the device. Brightness to a certain level there is. Not too bright!I was disappointed with the glitches it gives when you fold the laptop and it asks for tablet mode and suddenly it gets confused and gives glitches with the keyboard not closing. Also NOT good for sketching! Says it won’t take your palm’s touch while drawing  but it does and clicks everywhere. Also not take this review that serious this is my personal review! GO TO A SHOWROOM FIRST CHROMA OR ANY OUTLET see first what the product has to offer then buy it. AND OH WAIT, THE PRODUCT CAME NICELY PACKED THANKYOU AMAZON YOU’RE LOVE. So this is  What I didn’t like about it! And I think it had to be because I use MacBook with the buttery smooth workflow! God Apple has ruined lives. I think at her age. She’s in 9th standard. This will totally benefit her. and is a very good laptop for that purpose. But not recommended for heavy users. They can go For an i5 or i7. If not chuck everything and buy apple! THE MOST BEAUTIFUL THING DESIGNED from every aspect!

"Hi! I've ordered a laptop and I appreciate the timely delivery of the product. But It's been just 2 months since I got the laptop and sometimes it hangs and for the past few weeks its showing a blue screen error and the frequency is higher. I'm really disappointed with this and I would like to return this or replace this with some other laptop.
"
"Looks and feels premiumVery nice display. Crisp and sharpTouch screen performance is not great, just aceptableBut considering the price tag as well as the Hybrid SSD the boot up and shut down take agesI will recommend that you do not buy this from amazon and rather buy it from a reliable store.They sold a faulty laptop to me and do not have the necessary technical know how to address the problem.If you are ready to spend an hour a day repeating the same issue to customer care executives only to receive empty promises for more than 2 weeks then please go for amazonPS : They do replace the product after 3 weeks

"I get my lapi in 1one day delivery. Look was awesome. Some times it's performance was slow .In specs I saw 8gb ram,but they 4gb ram.They said 8gb nand flash memory for fast boot of laptop.

"please don't buy, this is one of the worst laptop I have ever seen.and don't call on hp support they put you on hold for 21 minutes anddisconnect the call. Still following up with the hp support for hardware they have changed the network cardand they want to change some network wire, waste of time and money. btw call support already did the reinstallationand hardware support again want to do that.
"
"It’s a very nice laptop in this price range and i have been using it for 4 months now its super fast boot up and Sceen quality is superb,Audio is very crisp but little low on bass but overall I would highly recommend it but if you can spend a 10k more get the i-5 version that is much faster while multitasking and A better deal.
"
"Looks amazing, extremely light for laptops in the below 50k. Touch screen sensitivity can take some time to get use not as responsive as one would expect. Perfect for folks to are on the go and need a laptop handy.Overall great product.

"I bought this laptop thinking its vfm with what's offered at the discounted price, but I was so wrong.Let's see what I got for the price I paid.1st laptop: It arrived, I booted it up and updated everything, but as it was new I did not bothered to check around but upon later I came to know it was a defrctive one. The fan inside was touching some part because of which it used to make weird sound and this caused it too rotate slow. Because of this the cpu was not able to get enough air and it caused the cpu to cut down power which slowed down the whole laptop. Also the seal was tampered one so I decided to file for a replacement.Amazon representatives were of no help even after 3 calls and conversation of several hours, finally 4 days later my replacement was confirmed. Until then the representative made sure that they tried every single trick on me to force me to keep the product and keep me stalling.Replacement arrived after 2 days of confirmation and the old one was picked up at the same time.Replaced Laptop: Screen bleeding or burn in not so sure of but it was present, screen upper whole part was yellow and the other than that the whole screen was white. Left side panel was not fitting properly and something was coming out of it, keyboard was hit and miss, it sometimes did not took input.As it was a replacement, asking amazon to take it back was not going to be possible as I had seen how they were acting when they had to send in a replacement. Went ahead and filed a complain with hp, they sent an engineer who checked out the laprop and to his surprise the laptop's hard disk lock was broke which caused improper fitting of panel and thing poppong out of panel. He was not able to diagnose what the issue was with the panel but it was surely visible and even he was confused. The keyboard issue was also detected and he asked me what would I like, a replacement or a repair.As my return window with amazon was available and also hp has 11 days replacement option, I went ahead for replacement, to which I was provided a doa letter which I had to send to amazon and procure a replacement.I went ahead called up amazon, to my surprise the guy was hellbent to send an amazon technical representative at my place to diagnose the laptop, even though hp's own engineer had already carried it out, well location was not in their covered facility due to which they finally asked me what I want and I went for return as replacement for the third time was just illogical.My money was refunded, and to those who are willing to buy it, let me shed some light on another issue:Laptop Price that I had paid Rs50990HP's MRP Rs59990 upon hp's discount at store or online store you will end up paying from 55k to 56k.But as I bought the laptop from another online retailer other than their own website or local resellers, it was not eligible for hp's offers that can get you 1st year adp with 2 year extended warranty for Rs999. I was forced to shell out Rs6999 which will get me only 2 years extended warranty nothing else.So the lesson i learnt was buy products from exclusive partners where you can get offers, or else you will end up shelling out more money for the same thing.I am attaching video where you can see how the fan caused the cpu to drop down speed from 100mbps to 4mbps and photos wjere you can see faulty replacement for your reference.

"
"The build is amazing the plastics are nice and the chasis is aluminium. Comes loaded with spec. Probably the the most ideal laptop for now. The boot time is under 6 secs which is pretty good. The only downside the screen lacks anti reflective properties, which is not much of a problem considering the FHD IPS display is very good.

"I was in search for a good quality laptop for my parents. The requirement was - Should be good quality, with NO DVD drive (so it can be thin), good screen under 14"" size, big keys but overall small keyboard, Sleek and under 2KG, rate ~35K, With MS office pre-installed, etc.Surprisingly for me, this checked all the boxes. The initial feel was that as a great product for my parents. Only time will tell if this holds up to the expectation. However, currently happy with the purchase.

"
"I purchased this laptop in January 2019. It is compact, light weight, and has good battery backup of around 6 hours with wi-fi usage. Since, this model has i3 processor its good for basic computing like web browsing, MS office, etc. and not recommended for hardcore gaming.

"
"Best budget gaming laptop. My only concern is the battery life. In battery it lasts for 3.5 hours if you game, 4-5 hours if you watch a movie and 6 hours if you work.
"
"Important Message: Seller will sell you very very old product with already expired warranty and on a bundled extended warranty which varied between 6 month or less based on how old is your product. Don't panic, kindly contact HP India support center with your amazon purchase bill with product serial number and they are normally kind enough to reset your product brand warranty. Mine is still under process.Product Review: Let me set the expectation straight, it is a budget laptop.Build quality is plastic, but do not flexes much. Screen is not IPS, but HD quality and anti reflective. Key board is well layed out, but I find the back lit LEDs are bit too bright to my choice. Camera is okeyish, mic and sound is adequate; good for your regular skype calls.1 TB SATA and a old school DVD writer means, laptop is heavy. I would any day prefer to trade off DVD writer for some reduction in weight. Mind you, you will need a table to work on it for long.MS office 2019 H&S comes as lifetime free, but please follow process mentioned in Amazon video to get it activated. Actually, you will have to log in into your MS account from the installed word, activate Office2019 and then download and install it, as the installed version is Office365 trial.As expected with sATA, booting will take some time. I am not a gamer, so can't comment on that. Battery back up is very good for the price, expect 4-5 hours with regular work.Too early to comment on performance, but again it is Ryzen and not i5 and cost some 5k less.Overall, I would term it as a perfect home laptop for every one' use.
"
"Good configuration. Nice looks. Value for money laptop.
"
"Laptop warranty only 2 months remaining... Amazon why cheat us? Now what I do??
"
"Like the color dont like delivery timingOverall the product is very good
"
"Superb product superb build wuality
"
"Before I write a review I want the readers to understand that it's my honest review and experience. Please don't go for this product specially online. Try to go to store and look for other option in this button. I swear I never use a laptop worse than this. My Sony Vio E series was far better with i3 processor.If we talk about the value for money, it's really not. Battery life is poor. Optane memory is to fool us. You will. It find a performance of i5 8th and optane memory. Nvidia graphics card will not work individually. Got blue screen within 7days of purchase. The worst part is customer care. My call disconnected several time and no response on email. Choice is up to you, it might not be a case with everyone but I'm facing it for the price I paid for HP. Pen with the laptop is of worst quality.
"
"Amazon provided extremely poor delivery. Took 13 days to deliver the product. I had to cancel and reorder the product. Overall laptop is good including build and performance.Pros: elegant looks, screen quality excellent (5/5), track and keyboard smooth, performance wise good, quick start/ boot due to optane (5/5), sound level high (4/5) had heating issues at first but after replacement its perfectly fine (5/5)Cons: touch screen 3/5 (sometimes touch doesn't response well, not very accurate for sketching using stylus,  leave hand marks behind on sketch while using stylus), had heating issues on medium gaming or while using tablet mode, sound bar is on keyboard side so while using tent mode or tablet mode sound becomes little feeble, battery life is not as shown in description- works 3.5-4 hr on video streaming, sound quality could be made better.
"
"The laptop is hanging too much probably a manufacturing defect.... 10 days haven't completed yet..... So want to return
"
"Do not fall for the amazon descriptionThere is no world cameraThe RAM is 8 GB nit 16GB as given in product descriptionAnd Amazon doesnt even provide a HP box with the laptopAlso it is mentioned that the battery life is around 8 hoursIts 4 to 5 hours actuallyPlease update the product detailsHighly Dissatisfied

"I love the laptop.Light easy to carry around.
"
"One of the best
"
"visit  drtechnno  dot  com for videos and youtube channel ""drtechnno""I have made lot of videos on this model, do check outAdvantages:1. Fingerprint sensor works very fast2. Mx130 graphics which is almost same as previous Gen 940mx for mod gaming3. Full HD resolution screen4. 360 degree rotatable screen.5. Intel Optane 16gb faster than a SSHD. It's a dedicated memory in the m.2 SSD slot6. Micro bezel screen which makes the laptop really compact.7. Easy upgradability by just removing back screws.Both RAM and SSD is easily accessible than previous gen. Previous gen SSD was easy to access but ram was on other side of motherboard. So needed complete disassembly.8. WILL UPDATE SOON as was busy upgrading to a proper ssdCons:Don't buy if not planning to invest in a ssdUpdate 16/6/2018touch is as usual awesome and sensitivebattery life is 4-6 hours depending on usage but 9 hours is doubtful.
"
"Got it from an authorized HP store near my place in 70k plus an additional 2.5K for  B&O A1 speaker worth 19k. The laptop is fantastic, feels premium  and is blazing fast. The only negative with this laptop is its battery life which doesnt last longer than 4hrs with battery saver on....at full brightness it wont last more than a couple of hours but the good thing is that it comes with fast charging.  The display is on the warmer side but everything look crisp on it. Speaker is good and tuned by B&O but doesnt feel as good as on some of the premium laptops which cost about 1laks or higher. Overall its a nice laptop with an av. battery life.
"
"I am getting lot of fan sound.. I don't understand what's the problem..
"
"For such high value, laptop is not upto the mark of customer expectations. Very poor battery life, only lasts 2 hours. Fan sounds like lappy is on fire. Slow. Mac air is lot better to opt at this price.
"
"I love this productEverybody likes it's styleIt's worth for moneyEnjoy a more immersive viewing experience with the new 5.33 mm micro bezel display which makes the 14 inch screen feel bigger in a slimmer design. Enjoy crystal-clear images of the full HD IPS touchscreen with the vibrant quality of 2 million pixels and 178 degree wide-viewing angles.

"This laptop is true package of all the needs a laptop can fulfill.The SSD in it is fast.. Though not very fast. 1 Tb Hard Disk along with it provides ample storage.The display is amazing. Its damn crisp.Battery life (have not tested a lot) but should last about 4 hrs.Average Gaming can be done.. Although heat can be an issue over prolonged periods of gaming.The keyboard is nice and clicky..The backlight is bright enough for dark environment.The Speakers.. Man these are the best i have ever heard in a laptop. They are tremendously loud and clear.Overall feel of it is great.. Its light and sleek.
"
"Product is gud in this price range but the best thing is its sound quality.I buyed it from Hp exclusive showroom with only 61,000 and with a original hp bag.
"
"It is a very good product at this price range.I bought  it from  an hp exclusive store  @61000.It really comes with HP trendsetter backpack but I got HP odessy backpack!(online price is  a liitle high, better to go for hp offline  store and I think online sellers don't provide bag with it)It comes with genuine windows 10 and ms office with licenceIt throttle from 3.8ghz to 2.3ghz in heavy use(max-69degree C).Its just fine,works like a charmIt is really handy it's only 1.8kg thin and sleek.Sound is loud and clear.And in case of looks it is the best in my opinionComes with an nvme with read speed of 1500mb and write speed of 600mb.It is really fast but not as fast as  samsung evo nvme,but its good.

"It doesn't have the screen flickering problem unlike cs1000tx. Contains 256GB SSD at this price which is astonishing. Sound quality is awesome. The new hinge mechanism is the best part. The screen frame has a small error but its absolutely fine. Bought it from HP store @63000 and got a bag free

"Who wins the race for best ultrabook? Dell XPS 13 9370 or HP Spectre x360? For me HP was the answer :)If you are like me and stuck between a budget of 1.3L to 1.5L, go with this laptop. Already Dell India is not selling Dell XPS 13 2-in-1 and also normal 9370 is costly af ranging around 1.45L. With exchange I just paid 3k more and got much better deal and much better configurations with this product. (Saved 35k)First of all the laptop's a beaut. Maybe the most gorgeous laptop in most gorgeous packing I've ever seen. The UHD display with Nvidia graphics just blew my mind. Sound quality is awesome and gives a full surround feeling. Although I would say I'm little disappointed with the battery life and keyboard feedback. Also this deal doesn't include thunderbolt to USB 3.0 and ethernet dongles so that's a let down too.But in summary - Beast of a laptop with high discount. Trust me, you won't get a better deal anywhere (I've searched online and offline both).
"
"Beast has a new Name. For all those who are in doubt that this laptop is not covered in India for warranty purpose, go ahead and buy it. I got my laptop on May 18th & verified with HP customer care that its warranty is covered in India. For people who value quality over price, this is the best laptop which money can buy in India.Touch: marvelousDisplay: amazingKeyboard: ComfortableWifi: perfectSpeakers: had a minor issue within 10 days of purchase but since i am a music buff i complained to HP online customer support via chat.they sent a technician and replaced the speakers.360 rotation: awesomeThis is a laptop which can pay its price back within 2-3 months ( if your work involves a laptop ). It's something which can be called ""Your Pride, and reason for Neighbours jealousy.For those who are considering to going for Dell 4K display laptop ( same config ), DONT. Dell has the webcam at bottom of the screen for its 4K display laptop. Looks weird & stupid during Online meetings.Conclusion: I am really thankful to Amazon for this amazing laptop at great price. It is a no-brainer. If you have the money go for it.

"Excellent Premium Laptop to Buy...Every Tech Savvy Person Wont Miss a chance to Compliment its Look and Tech Specification
"
"For 40k bucks you can not beat this deal. I haven't even installed the ssd yet. Running off the original hard drive. Works perfect. Little slow to load windows, but wakes from sleep in a second. Computer runs perfectly smooth. I have 2 monitors connected hdmi and vga ports, no problem whatsoever. (3 screens simultaneously with no problem) When I see bad reviews I guess they got a lemon or they are expecting too much. As for bad reviews with software problems, well that sounds like computer illiterates and has nothing to do with the quality of the computer. Great deal, do not think it can be beat. Only downside is no backlit keyboard.Also, Get 10% Cashback on this or Any Laptop by Ordering through vqr.in/80.

"Well i was looking for a laptop within a budget of 30K. Once you carefully compare the lineup HP and Asus are the clear contenders in this category (Lenovo i don't trust ever since the Superfish incident and because of their terrible displays). The asus X555 LA's are fantastic overall but the major draw back would be the inbuilt battery. Laptop longevity dictates that you have removable batteries for later replacement which won't be an option!Reasons why I chose the 250 G5:1. DDR4 2133 Ram: the latet and the fastest category2. The i3 6006u is one of the best budget to mid level chips out there in terms of battery/performance. Its a 14nm chip and hence also the heat levels are non existent. The onboard Intel HD 520 is sufficient for up to 4k video playback. My personal use suggests that it plays even the GTA 5 in the mid graphics level. (If you are a gamer though you may consider the HP 15 with AMD A10 and dedicated graphics priced slightly higher)3. The Matte screen - as my work would involve a lot of reading and Office use a matte display is way better than the HP Brightview screens on competing models.4. Build - the G5 is built like a tank; the plastics overall are par with the price you pay5. After Sales: HP and Dell have the best after sales support in our part of the country.6. Bluetooth and Wifi: This model comes with the latest gen BLE 4.2 and Dual Band wifi - none of these are available on any other model at this price. My own surfing speed has gone up by 2mbps on an average.NOTE:1. The drivers are auto updated in Windows 10 - no extra hard work required. Its a Free Dos unit and you will have to install your own version of Windows 10. I went with the Win 10 PR0 64bit.2. No laptop carry bag is includedThings i wished were better:1. The display - like all TFT panels in up to 40k laptops this one doesnt win any awards. Its usable and functional with average viewing angles. Bear in mind i'm comparing it to IPS panels which would cost atleast 50k and above. This won't hold a candle to my Dell S2440 Desktop Monitor which has a SHARP IPS panel.2. The trackpad has a plasticky texture - i personally prefer the smooth trackpads of ASUS Laptops which are actually comparable to Macbooks. Though the HP trackpad is perfectly fine in daily use - i'm nit picking here.Would recommend this laptop as the best model under 30 K.Cheers! :)

"I needed a 14inch screen laptop with optical drive because i admire portabilty in every sense and this is exactly that. Battery life is upto 3hrs and could be more if you increase the power saver mode. It also charges quite quickly when plugged to electricity supply. I've used it for morethan a month now and everything seem good so far. It is more like a notebook pc. It is of light weight Not even upto 2kg. I installed the windows myself though. Sound is relatively ok for its size

"I want to make something clear. The people buying this laptop are not fools. They know Ultrabooks exist. At this price point Ultrabooks are normal.ButPeople who are suffocating with Windows for a decade and half and unable to shift to the ""fruit"" for practical reasons, this device is a boon. And truly a glimpse of future.An offline capable Chromebook with whole play store to choose from.For everyday office works to high end gaming and internet browsing is a breeze.A very light OS, with Intel 8th gen board and 8GB RAM,= Scary fast performance.Superb build quality. Premium finish. Solid feel, no creaks.Dedicated volume keys.Seamless updatesSeamless syncSeamlessly connected, mobile, PC and TV.The heaven I was waiting for.Oh. And the sound quality is GOOD.You cant expect 5.1 surround sound from a 1 cm thick laptop.But sound is that good, that in a quiet room, you do not need headphones or speakers.No cons till now.Wait for price drop if you can. I was impatient to buy it.

"
"Hardware :I would highly suggests others to not buy this laptop at this price point. Chrome OS have very limited use cases and with 64 GB of eMMC storage it's even worse. A 50k+ laptop with 64 GB eMMC storage. Are you fooling Indian customers? For those who don't know eMMC is just like phone SD cards and they are not fast like typical SSDs (like Samsung or Intel SSDs). Only reason why this computer boots faster than say a Windows laptop of similar specs is because of Chrome OS. Although the screen on this is actually good IPS but I can't comment on actual quality though. Other specs are also good 8GB Ram and i5 CPU.Chrome OS : Chrome OS is a Linux distribution made by Google which is just a glorified Chrome browser with somewhat Android App support. The idea is that most people use there computers for browsing only so a chrome browser would be sufficient. It makes the OS fast and lot more secure than full fledge OS like Windows.The problem is that Chrome OS is very limiting for a student. I as a student use many more software other than Google Chrome on a daily basis. You may argue that Android apps are replacement for those applications but that's not the case.I can't compare Microsoft Office 2019 to the android version of Microsoft Office. Things get even worse for other specialized softwares like coding, engineering, image editing, video editing etc.Overall Verdict:Don't buy this laptop. It won't be useful for students, businessmen, or anyone for that matter. You can get i5 CPU, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD (actual ssd not fake eMMC drive) for even less than this (look for Asus).It maybe only useful for some niche catagory who wants a laptop to check email and browse web or watch movies only but again 64 GB storage is very limited to store movies and you would have a better experience with Windows 10.

"I am an electrical and electronics engineer and started using computers from 1984 onward. This might have been my 8th or 9th laptop since 2004. The product was delivered on 9th Nov 2018, but the accessories like screen guard were delivered on 14 Nov only. I opened the pack only after that. Took few days to install the required programmes. The first full day use was on 21 Nov and by afternoon, the laptop began to heat up at an unbelievable rate. The fan is running at high speed but that portion is so hot that you will not be able to touch it. When complained Amazon flatly refused replacement ( since this issue happened on 11 th day of purchase and they can take back if it is on 10th day) and asked to seek the warranty from the manufacturer. I am stuck with this product after paying about Rs 60000. Don't go near this product or seller or Amazon.
"
"There is some problem with this laptop. Its sound will stop working after 10-15 day use probably due to some defective driver from hp. Once this happens, no matter what you do, the sound will  not work. Uninstall Install driver, troubleshoot by windows troubleshooter even restoring does not work. Visiting hp service center is actually a headache but that is the only option left now.
"
"It's been 2 weeks since it was delivered, 2 major problems have already occurred. First somehow the laptop won't open, I then have to fix it with the help of videosSecond problem was that suddenly it's audio drivers were not working then I had to reinstall them. Otherwise trackpad is good,sound is good, touchscreen is good, graphics is good

"Pros :1. Durable, Excellent specifications2. SSD so it is super fast, comes with Microsoft XP office, Windows 10 and Mc Affee (1month valid only)3. Rose gold color is a plus4. The stylus is an additional plus point5. x360 and good hinge support gives many viewing angle options6. Battery life is ~ 3-4 hours7. It is heavier than the EliteBook version of HP8. Excellent packing and super fast delivery in 8 hours by Amazon.Cons :1. Double check the warranty of the product on HPE Website2. The warranty starts before the purchase hence need to be re-aligned or adjusted by producing the invoice3. None as of now

HP warranty is shown as only 4 months after registering product at HP website, Solved by contacting HP customer care and Warranty increased to 1 year.2.Fan was noisy at start due to heat, after updating bios and few windows 10 required updates and changing few startup settings, this issue is solved.Overall a above average touch, SSD 8GB Laptop at the price range of 54K-56K

"Continuous Yellow tint/hue on laptop screen display, instead of being a normal white display. Even movies played, photos and apps are shown with a yellow hue.Tried colour callibration in colour management, nothing works.It could be that laptop model itself could be faulty.Amazon laptop technician will come to inspect the item after 7 days, and provide his report, after which the product can be replaced.

"Bought this laptop on 12th Oct... Within 2 weeks, audio went off due to defective driver update from HP. Since I didn’t had much data, restored it back to factory settings n issue resolved. After that, started getting BSOD every time I started my laptop. Reported to HP support, they refused to exchange as it was more than 15 days. L2 back and forth took 15 days before service center took the laptop. They reinstalled OS (without my permission) and I lost recovery plus the pre-loaded office 2016. Frustrated - never buying HP again

"Got it through the Great India Festival discount at approx Rs 55K. It has exceeded my expectations. It is a brand new OEM box sealed product from HP and recognized as such for warranty. Fantastic delivery and pickup of old laptop, no much hassles despite the festive rush. Audio output is superb. The laptop looks and feels great, the screen is almost the size of a regular 15 inch one. Soft keypad, backlit, folds to a tablet 180 degrees. The stylus is great for free hand sketching and drawing. Mine is a 128 SSD model, is super light and portable. Ideal for students and professionals. Battery lasts almost 5 hours with moderate work. Great to watch videos on. In short, an ideal performance laptop.

"The product is sent with a Pen, two additional nibs which can be used to draw, take notes, or and immediately  convert to text.Using it for 6 months nowCons:* If improperly configured may give occasional hangup.* Touch is good but not as good as Surface pro or IPad* Lot of unwanted things must b gotten rid of for better performance.* A little bit of heat issues but managable.Pros* Comes with MS Office 2016 which is 15k iotherwise in Market.*Good Boot time hardly 1minute with minimal start menu and quick heal* battery has Ok life lasts 5 hours for normal office work(qua legal profession).* Pub g emulator works OK but 3 hours max Pug G battery life :)

"Battery back-up is lesser than mentioned in specifications.
"
"Pros- Item available at a much lesser price in Amazon than the market. Its design is good, battery backup is excellent with moderate use. I am sure battery backup will be much less if games are played in it. It comes with pre-installed MS Word, Excel, Powerpoint which is otherwise costly to buy.Cons- I faced issue in purchasing extended warranty from HP. HP people offer 2yrs extended warranty for items purchased from their website/ local sales counter at a much lesser price. However, they quote significantly higher amount if item is purchased from Amazon! Reason best known to them.My advice is that if you are looking for extended warranty , then compare prices in Market and online price+extra cost for extended warranty.

"July 2, 2018The unit (Vendor Name is:  AYR Tech) was delivered on June 30 2018.  However, Faulty  product was delivered by the Vendor that did not meet the following specifications:1.  MS Office Home and Student 2016 version  was missing;  (Software Issue)2.  Key board was supposed to back lit;  but it not.  (Hardware Issue)3.  The Unit seems to have heating issues, The fan came on (loud) when I turned the machine and it was on constantly all through the time I was setting it up the machine.  This suggests probably the Unit has heating dissipation issues. (Hardware issue)The above issues were confirmed in the Amazon Tech Service call Report on July 2 2018 (I found out about the Back-lit key board later after the Tech Left).  The faulty unit is being picked up (yet to know when).  Also I am not sure when I am going to receive the Replacement Unit.  I will add additional comments and revise my rating if necessary after the resolution.July 6 2018I received a replacement Unit rather promptly, the very next day on July 3, 2018 and the unit met all the specifications.  The Heat dissipation issue (fan coming on and remaining on - rather loud) still seems to exist.  I am not sure if this issue can be resolved for this unit.  Other than that, the unit is nice with a beautiful screen and fast start.I am revising my rating from 1 star to 3 stars.  (3 starts because I did spent the whole day trying to get a replacement unit;  the heat dissipation issue still seem to exist.)

" Don't get conned into buying this fancy piece of junk. It has serious design flaws and low grade plastic components are used.  Within a month of buying this laptop the hinges got jammed and started pushing the screen and screen back panel which soon gave way and cracked. After following up with HP customer care they lethargically acted on it and replaced the screen. Soon after wifi card collapsed, mouse pad had a wavy bump on it ,  and hinges got jammed again. On informing HP customer care about this issue they did not send anyone for 45+ DAYS even though laptop has an onsite repair warranty for a year. By now the hinge had totally jammed and cracked the whole base panel and top panel when I tried to close the screen.  After 45 days of following up and laptop falling apart and rendered useless I had no choice but to personally drop the laptop at service center. Since then, It's been  3 weeks and HP says the damage is accidental and that I caused all the damage and sent a quote of 20k to replace base panel and  I mean WTH ! .  My hard earned 65k is gone!On top of it all, This is known issue with HP laptops. Simply googling ""HP hinge design issue"" will give multiple similar issues raised by users.Attached  pictures with different stages of hinge collapsing body body cracking.

" I have purchased the laptop on July 8, 2019 and I have used just three weeks. On 29 July, 2019, as usual, switch on the system than, I have heard some spork🔥 sound near the Fan.

I don't know what can I do further.

"Don't buy this product please. I request all the people who think of buying any laptop of HP. They don't provide good service especially when you're in small cities or rural areas. My laptop had some hardware issues , it is not resolved till now and in future, it'll not be. Now, I'm going to tell you what happened, first in June 2019 , there was an issue of overheating, it got resolved but after some days. On 26th July'19,  I lodged a complaint regarding the hardware issue as first it was smelling like something was getting burnt in it when I put it in the charging as it was not starting I thought that I should do charging , I kept it aside so that of it is gets harmed, it'll not affect us. Let's come to the point, when I logged a complaint in HP via chat, the engineer visited on 7th August and detected a fault i. e. in mother board. Then Engineer visited again on 14th August for replacing mother board and the engineer asked me to make a system recovery by stating some steps by telling us that he does not have much time to do system recovery. He returned. I've done the exact steps. When the process was about to finish, the window crashed out and it couldn't open. Finally when I called them, they said aaj kal and till now, the issue didn't resolve. I stated them all my situations that I'm in 12th board class and I take tutorials from my laptop and I do practice in it. Everything had gone on vain. Also, I talked to the headquarter of HP, they supported only their service centres. They asked me to pay some amount in thousands for the installation of windows but why should I pay? It's the falut of the technician. I don't have much technical knowledge. Moreover, my laptop is in warranty period. At last, I had to install a pirated window in my laptop from nearest shop. In that window, viruses were installed and when I tried to remove them, everything was in vain. What should a consumer do? Worst service ever. I'm in boards and my time has lost due to this issue. So please don't buy this laptop not only of this model but of this company. Please read one by one word very carefully. According to me, this review will help the consumer to be aware of these things. Even I talked to many people who're using hp laptop are not happy by using this.

"Review Unit: Intel Core i7-8565U (whiskey lake),16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, 1W UHD (1080p) touchscreen with HP SureView, Dark Ash Silver with Copper accentsNote: Review submitted after 46 days of using laptop as daily driverThe HP Spectre ×360 is by far one of the most sleep Ultrabooks on the market. It's only competitor is perhaps the Dell XPS 13.In this review, I will be drawing many comparisons with the aforementioned Dell XPS of similar specifications.-----Design (5/5): The very first sight of my new Ultrabook was enough to make me fall in love with it. This is by far the most visually appealing laptop there has ever been (unless you're into big fat laptops from the early 2000s, in which case, this is definitely not for you). The color of the unit, the 'gem cut' design, the faceted corners, and pretty much everything about this laptop (including the luxurious, and thoughtful, packaging) screams premium.The Dell XPS has a rather elegant simplicity, but like most others, I would buy the HP Spectre just for its design. The side bezels are tiny, whereas the chin and upper bezels are relatively fat, which may give some a slightly aged impression. However, the extra bezel allows for a camera above the display (no nose cam like the 2017 XPS), one with Windows Hello IR facial recognition (which the its Dell counterpart doesn't have). Also, the same extra size on the keyboard deck allows for an extra speaker, which sounds beautiful (more on that later).Durability- The chassis is carved out of a single piece of aluminium, which makes for a very sturdy build. However, I did notice a good deal of flex on the screen, and on the keyboard deck. And after 45 days of usage, I realized that the right side of the keyboard deck was ever so slightly elevated, enough to wobble the screen when repeatedly pressed down.HP generally doesn't compare very well to Dell when it comes to build quality, but this laptop, being their most premium 13 incher, does fairly well in that domain.-----Port Selection (4/5): The ports on this device include 2 USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports, either of which can be used for charging (and one of which is placed on the right hand side chamfered corner), 1 USB A, a 3.5mm headphones jack, and a MicroSD card reader. As one can expect from a thin and light Ultrabook, there is no Optical reader on this device (nor is there an Ethernet cable port). This is great for legacy support, and at the same time, you can hook the laptop up to 2 4k monitors.-----Display (4/5): The display draws just 1W of power, which boosts its battery life by a good deal, as opposed to the general 2W displays. The shiny screen does accumulate a lot of fingerprints, as does the all metal body of the laptop, and can also be the source of some annoying glare. This problem is further compounded by a relatively low maximum brightness (again, owing to the low powered display), which may not be suitable for outdoor use (for dark, low contrast content like 'the Battle of Winterfell'.This unit also comes with the HP SureView feature, which on activation by a simple function key, washes out the screen, drastically reducing the viewing angles. I didn't find myself using this feature very often, but the small lot of people using this laptop for business purposes may benefit from it in public areas. Also, the washed out screen resembles the feeling you get when you have migraines (thankfully, on a much more tolerable level), but it's still very much usable.The colors on the screen are vibrant, and even the closest details can be observed rather easily without even having to upgrade to the 4K screen (which is the 2W non sure view version, and also costs a little more). The blacks are deep enough to mistake for an OLED screen, which came as a relief to me, as I'm obsessed with those.-----Sound (5/5): For buyers looking for a portable personal daily driver suitable for content consumption, if the display and design didn't do the trick, the sound will mesmerize you into buying it. Tuned by Bang & Olufsen, these speakers get it just right when it comes to higher notes. The lows are very good, but as one can expect from such a thin laptop, they don't produce the deepest bass. But again, none of the laptops in this segment do.The Spectre's design fits in 4 speakers, such that no matter what orientation the 2-in-1 device is positioned in, a speaker is always firing towards the user, which provides for an always crisp audio output. This was one reason as to why I was actually disappointed when HP refreshed the design with smaller bezels, which resulted in the omission of the speakers above the keyboard.-----Battery (5/5): As HP advertises, this battery is a monster. Of course, claims of 22-23 hours of battery are nowhere near the actual time I get on one charge, but I do get about 10+ hours on medium to heavy usage including an IDE, heavy web surfing, and intermittent videos being played. This is thanks to the low powered display I mentioned earlier.-----Performance (4.5/5): This is probably the only category in which the Dell XPS may surpass the Spectre, which is not to say that the HP Spectre isn't powerful enough, though. The Spectre's fast quad core processor blew right past anything I threw at it. However, the fans did kick in pretty soon. Although they don't produce too much of a noise, and are slightly customizable in the HP Command Center, I guess that's one of the not so perks of having an all metal design. The top of the keyboard deck did get a little hot, being metallic, but it was nothing beyond the expected levels.As far as graphic processing is concerned, the Spectre ships with Intel's integrated UHD 620 graphics, which is adequate for content consumption, and maybe even some light video editing and gaming. But don't expect the Spectre to be put to studio use without getting very hot, very quickly.Toshiba's NVME SSD (the fastest kind) proved to be blazing quick, producing amazingly high read and write speeds. Intel's Gigabit WiFi (WiFi 6) card also proved to be very, very quick, which I could see when YouTube automatically chose HD video quality at points in the house where I'd never before even been able to connect to the router, with older devices.-----Tablet Mode (4/5): As the name of the computer suggests, the hinge can rotate all of 360 degrees, enabling 4 different positions for you to use it in - Laptop mode, tablet mode, and the intermediary Tent and presentation modes. While the tablet and modes was really pleasant for content consumption, I found the presentation mode practically unusable, owing the the large amounts of screen wobble. This would probably be best suited for a long presentation or a large movie, where the laptop would just go untouched for a long time. The screen wobble was also too much to enjoy using the included HP Pen comfortably on laptop mode. I was also annoyed when Chrome didn't automatically open the on screen keyboard when I pressed the address bar (unless I used the pen). As with most other pens that come with convertible laptops, the HP Pen, although very smooth and useful (with 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity) felt rather heavy to use. I look forward to them getting lighter, before using this to take hand written notes, which I wouldn't do anyway, on a laptop.-----Keyboard (5/5): HP, as always, impressed me with their wonderful keyboard. I took little time to adjust to this beauty, which had great feedback with its ample 1.4mm of key travel, and we'll spaced Chiclet style keys, with 3 different levels of back lighting, which was also very uniform with no bleeding.-----Trackpad (4.5/5): The glass trackpad is very wide, and tall enough for my liking. Many complain about the lack of Precision drivers for the trackpad, but I don't understand the furore. There is obviously a difference between the existing Synaptics drivers and the Windows native Precision drivers, but the great hardware reduces the difference into almost unnoticeable. The trackpad was adequately responsive, and all of Windows' multi finger gestures were supported, with the occasional, but never frustrating, hitch.----- Other Security Features: The Spectre also comes with a fingerprint reader connected right at THE BIOS level, which provides for a very secure method to log in to the device. However, the same results in the fingerprint reader being rather slow, painfully so at times. However, the facial recognition was really fast, and made up for it.In addition to the SureView display, HP also included a physical Webcam kill switch right below the USB C port on the right side, which when enabled, physically cuts power to the camera, and removes it at the BIOS level. This should provide some solace to you privacy freaks out there.----------The Verdict: 4.5/5The HP Spectre has long been my favorite laptop, but as with anything else under the sky, isn't perfect. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a fast laptop at home, or for general productivity tasks. The high speed SSD and the quick processor got me through everything without ever complaining about speed, other then when YouTube switched from full screen to normal, and vice versa, which took about a second, enough to not go unnoticed.While I would have really appreciated an OLED screen (which will be a part of the refreshed version as recently announced by HP), this got me through everything just as well.Value for Money: 4.5/5While I wouldn't say that the price tag (at the time of buying) isn't hefty, it sure is justified by the sheet quality and speed of the hardware and software components on the device. Add to that the convertible nature of the laptop, and you've got yourself a bang for your buck.

"The seller (Rentopcdotcom) offers very poor quality refurbished items. I purchased a laptop (HP Elitebook 840G1). The laptop had spurious parts and when asked about it, they don't respond. The RAM was unbranded and incorrect frequency (used 1033 Mhz instead of 1600 for this model). The charger was spurious and also had issues providing correct voltage. The screen had dead pixels but was still called certified refurbished. The only saving grace was the appearance which was not too bad. Hence please don't order high RAM and hard disk/ SSD config from these guys as they are spurious anyway. Please expect to spend more money on hard disk/ ssd, RAM, charger, battery. as all of these will be spurious . If sold for 20k levels, this becomes a bargain as we can easily change RAM and HDD by just taking off the user removable cover.

"The product is Good. And its great value for money. But I recommend to everyone if you can get more upgraded version of GeForce and higher clock at the same or nearly the same or within a litlle price difference then that vl be best for you. I vl add one thing that don't expect too much from the battery backup. You need to keep charger plugged while using it.Now coming to my concern. I bought this laptop in March 2019. After I checked the warranty online it was expired. I contacted HP customer care and the asked me for P-slip on which the serial no. of the product was written. I downloaded my P-slip and the serial no. written on it was different than that of my Laptop. I contacted Amazon for this and 1st they told me to wait for 24 hrs. After then nothing happened and now it has been almost 3 months and they still haven't solved my issue. Every time I contact Amazon they ask me to wait for 4-6 working days. And after that nothing happens and then when I contact them again they repeat the same thing. I fon't understand why amazon is so careless about my issue. Maybe they have given me the used product instead of real one thats why the serial no. is different and they are not changing it. I don't know what to do. They have already wasted my 3 months and also of warranty too. I also tweeted about my problem and tagged Amazon but they didn't respond. So, I recommend everybody not to shop from their site you can get the same laptop from Flipkart or other site also. Thats it...

"It's hanging and screen is flickering
"
"As I got an old manufactured product 2016 from the seller, the warranty was over by 6 months already. The screen was washed out colors with imperfect color gamut & lot of screen flickering while use of mobile calls & updates of OS . Battery life is pathetic with 2 hrs as said by HP CC as it's a 2 cell battery , though it's a gaming laptop. It should have been atleast 4 cell battery ,then smooth gaming without repeated charging. I have to call HP CC repeatedly & I got fed up with multiple issues .The lappy at is 3 kg, there is no point in carrying this brick with a small battery lifespan with 4 GB Nvidia dedicated graphics memory.It doesn't make any sense, system RAM is only 4gb  another downside by HP .  So with so many issues I would request the buyers to choose a good seller prior to it's purchase as u r investing 60K. I won't recommend this to anyone . Don't go by it's specs only. Be aware. Check at HP website about it's review also.
"
"You cannot do any kind of heavy work on it like gaming with high graphics or running a heavy program. You cannot play games like GTA, NFS because it hangs badly and the game lags too much. It is not compatible with most of the games or heavy programs because it contains Nvidia GeForce 940 MX 4 GB graphic card with is a very average one it could not handle heavy thing well. It takes too much time to start as compared to other laptops. If you go for i7 8th gen varient of this laptop it will cost you somewhere around 80000 which is totally a waste of money. So please be careful while buying this product, if you want to do only general and simple work then this is good for u.

"Bought this laptop from Nehru place, Delhi.I got it for 61500, pre GST with a nice bag. Using it for 4months on daily basis. This laptop is really powerful with Nvdia940mx gpu and 8gb ddr4 ram. I can run really heavy applications and games on it. Adobe softwares work like a charm, google earth too and etc.GTA runs at 45 -50fps at high settings 1600x900p resolution and  at 1080p, GTA runs at 35fps with normal to high settings.CSGO runs at 90-130fps on highest settings on full hd 1080p.Elder Scrolls 5 skyrim Special Edition runs at around 35-40fps on 1600x900 resolution at high settings.Witchers 3 runs at 30fps on mid to high settings at 1600x900 res.All Splinter cell games run at over 45fps at high settings.Tekken 7 runs at around 40fps at 1600x900p high graphics settingsDying light runs at 30-35fps at high settings on 1600x900 res.SOME OTHER PROS:1. Backlight keyboard2. intel 7th gen processor with intel hd 620 as integrated graphics and 4gb dedicated graphics3. Got Win 10 home edition and Microsoft office home and student 2016 with it.4. Got Cyberlink media player 14 pre-loaded on this laptop, which is better than VLC player. I also got cyberlink video editor, which is also nice.5. Full HD screen looks very beautiful to look at.THE ONLY DEMERITS OF THIS MACHINE:1. Users need to connect to a power source if they want to game on it.2. This laptop comes with 4GB ram only. so you have to upgrade it for better performance.3. Screen flickers sometimes. This Issue is solved to a certain degree with laptop updates but sometimes it can still flicker for 1-2 sec or so.4. Audio is a bit low even with B&O audio drivers. This can be solved by buying wireless or wired speakers, to enhance movie and music experience.5. Now this laptop is selling at Rs. 67000 which is a bit higher but still it is a really good laptop.

"
"From my experience of using this laptop for 2-Months, not worth for buying having lot of issues.Check the official HP online site and see reviews yourself. Worst laptop experience from HP and HP service center and store.Performance issues, display issues, cracking issues from hard drive HP service center technicians says these are normal use the laptop until failure..Seriously. selling imperfect product from reputed company.I repeat don't buy this laptop, specification are gimmics don't fall for that. Waste of money and headaches if anything i can wish i coud time travel 2- months before and avoid buying this laptop or get refund both seems not possible.

"It is almost 1 and half months now since I'm using this laptop. The laptop is very good in terms of looks and feel. The processor is i5 7th gen so processing is also amazing.

"First off, I planned to use this laptop for occasional gaming (Witcher, Fallout etc), taking handwritten notes on oneNote, general purpose, and some programming. It fulfills all of these purposes extremely well.Pros:1. Boots up in seconds thanks to the SSD. So, you can take notes instantly.2. Can write and draw with the included pen without problems, and with palm rejection.3. Nice speakers and screen4. Lightweight5. Can run Witcher 3 at high settings with ~30fps6. ~8 hours of batteryPrecautions:1. The battery for the pen is AAAA and is expensive.2. Heats. So, don't forget to buy a good cooling pad.3. No LAN port and optical drive. So, if you need these, you'll have to buy the LAN-USB cable and the external optical drive.4. The WiFi adaptor turns itself off now and then. I had to restart the laptop for it to show again. Probably a software issue and am working on it.5. Cortana is shit compared to Google's assistantFor me, this was the best deal at any price range. It's the best compromise between mobility, raw power, and touchscreen features.

With high usage, battery backup is almost 2.5-3 hours.3. Gets heated too, so buy a coolpad.

I compared this with my other Full HD laptops, in this laptop resolution is poor !! An HD video doesn't look HD on the screenOther configurations were all good. But the DISPLAY is a big disappointment !! For a Laptop of 1Lacs this was shocking to me. Even a 15K laptop has better display than this one.There would be heating and fan sound on top of the BAD display issueIn short - don't invest 1L on this laptop. Not worthit

"This is my first convertible, and my first laptop as well. So far I've had a great experience with the laptop. It is quick to launch, a reasonably great feedback on touch, and quite good build quality that makes it feel premium and long lasting. Converting the laptop into a tablet is a joy. The addition of pen that allows for pressure sensitive sketching/painting was a welcome decision and fostered a new hobby.Here's a quick rundown on the good/bad:The display being IPS has great viewing angles, but not the best brightness. Reasonably good.The keyboard is not as clicky as I'd have preferred, but still better than some other laptops I've tried.The touchpad could be bigger.The I/O choices are pretty great.The i7 is pretty fast for daily use as well as the occasional simulations I run on it.The battery has lasted pretty long in my experience, however, keeping it on performance mode usually kills it pretty quickly. The best batter life mode is what I always use, and thats pretty good.Charges quite quickly. (around an hour usually. 2 at max)Not heavy for normal use.The fan gets noisy during regular use when being used for a long time. Nothing deal breaking though.

"Specification is very well chosen aa per the current available technology by the hp team which is commendable

"This is a decent Laptop for moderate usage and has pretty catching looks as well. Overall it performs decently for average purposes. However if use it for demanding activities, then it starts becoming a room heater.Some obvious observations:-----------------------------------------Noted Problems:1. The display has an ugly yellow tint.2.  Keyboard back-light is completely manual. It does not have an automatic timeout that enables the light to go off after 5 seconds of inactivity. Hence it consumes more battery. Also, there is no brightness adjustment for the same.3. Some heating issues, when processor demand is high4. Battery running out quite fast 3 - 4 hrs max against promised 11 hrs.5. The active pen doesn't have a power button, so it is perpetually turned on, reducing the battery life. This becomes a pain, considering that AAAA batteries are exorbitantly priced (~INR. 900)6. Keyboard feel is not so plush, feels nothing great for an INR. 100K Laptop.7. Overall sturdiness is less compared to Dell Latitude series models8. Poor quality camera in place of Full HD Webcam as per specs9. The touchpad could have been better, no button on touchpad design is not great. Also, there's no trackpad/stick10. Indicator lights (power and HDD) LED's are located on the sides is not a good design, as we have to lean over to see if it is on or off.11. Same is the case with the fingerprint reader, which is located on the side. Could have been way better if it was in the face area itself below the keyboard.12. No Number keypad embedded or no number lock for the keyboard.

"Hi brought this Laptop directly in HP showroom for the price of Rs.90,000. Now, this got increased above 1 lakhs, so you can probably check at showrooms for prices and any complimentary (freebies). I today upgraded the RAM from 12GB to 32GB with Crucial RAM (16GB x 2) purchased directly at a shop in area Ritchie street (Chennai) for the price of Rs.4300 each (16GB). Before I upgrade I confirm the same from HP Communicate Support. You can refer the link for more details using the link and the speed is awesome after RAM upgrade to 32GB.https://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Notebook-Hardware-and-Upgrade-Questions/How-much-RAM-I-can-Ugrade-to-my-laptop-Pavilion-360-14/m-p/7184933#M523662

"Heating issue and battery life is approx 3-3.5 hrs on normal usage.Not good for gaming.Otherwise ,SSD  is very fast and Booting time is about 5 second.  Chargng is also fast.I played asphalt 9 on it and latop get heated like fire and also in gaming it will give about 2 hrs backup maximum.I will strongly suggest to buy a vacuum cooler for this laptop because it has side vent also.Cooling pad is not sufficient .I must suggest opolar vacuum cooler while playing pubg,asphalt 9,witcher and gta 5.Update-Battery life suddenly got increased to 2 hrs more on battery calibration.You will find this option in hp support and help option.I also suggest you to buy offline because it cost me only 86500.

"purchased this device from an HP store for 63K. The device is made of using a combination of metal and plastic. The left side of the device always remains cool whereas the right side sometimes heats up as that's where the processor is located. The device was initially running a little slow and i was disappointed but once all the windows updates and drivers were installed everything changed and it's blazing fast now.The battery life is good and I get around 4 maybe 5 hours ( if you're listening to music+watching videos and surfing the web). You can easily get 9-10 hours out of it if you're using it to type up documents or make presentations with light browsing.Changing my review from 5 starts to 4 stars because watching movies on this device is incredibly hard. The screen is very reflective and I'm looking at my own reflection half the time.RAM is 8GB not 12GB.Update after 2 months of usage-Battery life is still great, no lagging or slow down that is noticeable. only difference since the day i got it is that it takes maybe a couple of seconds longer to boot-up. even of low power mode + power savings enabled the devices breezes through most tasks effectively. I would also recommend users to actually make use of the windows 10 built in apps as compared to their alternatives as they appear to work better ( Microsoft edge, photos, groove music etc)<<random piece of advise. just in case you have a lot of  duplicate files use this free app called CloneSpy to get rid of any duplicates. helped me get rid of around 5gb in duplicate music files.>>
"
"Look of this laptop is good or great it's a personal choice for me it's great.Display is FHD and for me it's good ( no bleeding issue )For how it works - u can guess that by it's configuration. ( I use this for simple browsing )Webcam is in b/w average to good.Typing experience is okaybattery - I got around little more then 3 hours in normal browsing with 50% brightness.Audio quality is good.But the problem which I found while using this laptop is it's touchpad.  Whole touch pad and right and left click are not separate so whole touch pad shake when u click . Else touch pad is not that responsive.Suggestion - u should check it's ports before buying this laptop.
"
" I finally decided to buy this during the republic day sale and got it delivered yesterday (22 Jan2018) as i am a prime member. The spec is really good for this price and the asthetics of the laptop is very pleasing however i was shocked to realize that there is a manufacturing defect in the trackpad.The trackpad is not fixed properly to the frame, when i tap it slightly on the bottom centre or edges i can clearly see it moving up down and if i raise the laptop to my eye level i can see the trackpad is bulged out from the frame on the centre. I have raised this issue with amazon's technical team, i have sent them a short video of the problem and they have acknowledged that its a defect. Also i am very surprised as i don't understand how did this particular piece passed HP's quality checks.Finally got refund from amazon as the seller doesn't have any more stock left. A special appreciation for amazon.in technical team for promptly addressing this issue, I am changing my review to 4 star for support from amazon.

"ls dont buy...One of the worst worst product on amazon. I purchased it from its good reviews but the battery is not working well..lappy shows some error while working laptop and the charging of battery reduces frequently at a higher level..i.e.in 1min of time span,battery charge reduces by 2-3%, it is extremely terrible as i got laptop just recently delivered. And more important thing that, as it is a new delivered product but also it hangs frequently and switch off suddenly. So this is a very big issue I have seen,as the product is so costly but quality of product is extremely so bad...I must say, a very bad deal with amazon.. I will not buy anything from Amazon henceforth.....

In case ,its fully charged, I can full-charge my Nokia 5.1 by USB in standby 3+ times.If you want to unleash full power of this beast, you need to attach one 128/256GB SSD and one 8GB ram more & you're good to go!

"Different dProduct sold with extension warranty by Amazon which was displayed in HP website with serial number. I contacted HP customer care regarding warranty issue. Till  the date problem not solved. Camera quality is very very poor. Charger point is playing at system end.  System display quality is moderate. There is no proper space between monitor to base which may  leads to damage the product. it is not effective with 2GB graphic card

"I am writing review based on my bitter experience with poor hardware quality.Within 6 months of purchased laptop hinge joint (joint between keypad and screen) broken while normal closing laptop. And reason is one hinge joint was not able to close and other one was working properly. Because of  this many parts of laptop demaged (like keypad, joint, frame of screen, top frame).With Brand HP we should expect some what good quality.

"I had been using Lenovo for more than 2 years. But I had pathetic experience after 1 year. Because of the Battery problem and screen problem and keyboard problem,Now I have been using this laptop since a month. The keyboard is very tough comparatively Lenovo and customer support is very proactive to help. I would recommend guys who want to buys a mid range  or basic laptop around 30 to 35k. Please try to extend the warranty time if any offer is running or before lapse of your original warranty period,There are lot of difference between 4GB and 8GB RAM type, processing will be fast, Apart from will get a 2 GB Graphic card useful for high end website and mid range Games, Just after booting please update the Graphic form Redeon site and check it is active always so that you can get the best experience. The battery back up is superb with four cell power, Never leave it charging when the battery is 100% and in a month or twice, try to drain the full battery for long life.Though it looks  bit bulky but the quality is top notch. Never go for Lenovo's slim design and even am not satisfied with their customer support as i encounter wit them number of times. Above all I want to Thank Amazon delivery.Hope this review will helpful to you. Thanks

"This laptop is best in this price range. And yes you can play gta 5 and its very good. This is my first laptop, so i dont know how much heat and how much battery backup is normal. But while playing games, it heats and battery discharges really quick, so i recommend to play while plugged in. Windows 10 is running very nicely (64 bit). Only the boot time is long. Movie experience is too good. The sound is really clear and good. Was delivered in a good condition. Just the body is not too tightly packed. But that's not a big issue. Ports are working good. I needed a laptop for all needs and they were all fulfilled. Gaming, Movie, Songs, Official Work that's what i tried till now and i am satisfied. To end, i was very careful while buying laptop because it was my first laptop and also a laptop a laptop is a big thing. I did every research and found it the best. Just know that it is dual core. Which i didn't knew before buying it. And i dont have any problem in it.

Coming to the performance and charging time its pretty good. All the drivers were installed with some simple steps using Hp support assistant. Kindly note that there is no laptop bag is offered with the product. Seller should clearly mention about that.

"As a prime member, yesterday i receive this product from amazon. I would like to give 5 star for that service. But one thing which i dislike most is warranty issue. When i checked the warranty of the product in HP website it shows only 7 month warranty left. It shows that they are selling product with old manufacturing date.Apart from this issue, I found that overall product is good as mentioned in product details. Configuration is good. it comes with Core i3 processor, very light weight, 4gb DDR 4 RAM, Intel HD Graphics 520 with DirectX 12, Laptop, Battery, AC Adapter, User Guide and Manuals, comes with DOS operating system, 32 BIT.CONS-- No laptop bag,- Warranty issue [Now i have to buy extended warranty from HP website. It become expensive for me]- Sound quality is not up to the mark. It could be better.

"Nice product from HP. Worth for 27k. One might feel this would be slow if you run a Windows 10 even with 4 GB RAM, but if you load Linux it runs butter smooth. I use LinuxMint 18.3 and it's awesome. Battery backup is good and charing time is fast as advertised. Screen, I feel a tad low on quality for 15.6 inch even when it's HD. If this was a Full HD screen, its worth every penny. Very happy with this item and have to mention the ontime Prime Delivery.....Kudos Amazon.

"Read great reviews. Really had all I was looking for in a laptop.However, it started having unexpected freezes after just two months. Been complaining with the service centres and am being told various tales of faulty drivers, no issues etc. Now after for months of hassle, they are suggesting that the motherboard requires to be replaced. Has been a frustrating experience dealing with a faulty laptop and the very unresponsive service centres.Battery life was around 4 hours.Touch screen worked well when the laptop worked.Pencil / stylus demonstrated a slight lag...... Was sub par!!Suggest that people consider the surface range of laptops in its stead.
"
"Laptop looks awesome and stylish.  Touch is superb. Performance is decent. Tablet mode is good.However minor dislike is .. little bit on heavier side, minor heating can be felt. Lot of unnecessary apps installed.Overall a great buy.
"
"very unfortunate experience ....Laptop hinges , screws, edge line below touch pad are giving electric shocks when connected to power........ filled  an replacement request
"
"Best laptop in this price range and have smooth functioning. Need some improvement in battery and laptop weight..

"Packing is poor when laptop delivered.Sometimes laptop get heating.C drive memory is less.Finger print authentication is not good.Camera quality is so so.Antivirus provided is only for a month.Overall laptop is good.
"
"Touch screen and Pen is a real bonus. It works like charm.  Excellent screen resolution. Battery life is not that great but works for about 3.5 hours, cannot be compared for Macbook Air. So far, no issues with Windows 10. It works smooth. Overall a good personal and small business use laptop as it comes with MS Office Word, Excel and powerpoint 2016.
"
"Thats a really great laptop, very fast, screen is beautiful however the screentouch is not useful at all as I thought.Only con is fingerprint locker is quite bad itBut everything else is good
"
"It was mentioned that it has Microsoft office 2016, in fact it has only trial version.
"
"Value for money when compared with Mac and surface book.Using it for 2 months smooth experience. although reviews here were not very upbeat but on some other websites it had amazing reviews.Its price has increased because of inflation and rupee depreciation.
"
"Battery life is goodStylish lookLight WeightSometimes it get heatedOverall it is a very good laptop and I really feel so good when I work.
"
"Better than any other laptop in that range
"
"Everything is awesome but sometimes fingerprint sensor not respond properly.
"
"Windows pre installation is extremely poorly done. I faced lot of problems with drivers and sound. No graphic card is one big issue that this laptop has. If you want to use it for day to day use, it's very good.
"
"Quality size and hard disk and ram capacity. Metallic overall. Speed fast. Original windows and MS Office. Go for it.
"
"Hi bought this laptop recently. It was working fine when I bought it. Suddenly sound is not working..no volume or sound is coming.may I know the reason.and how to I rectify it

"I liked the hybrid laptop as I can easily rotate the laptop to tablet mode and vice versa.The hinges are well built and the display is stunning too. The writing part with the pen is with no visible lag although there is no pairing with bluetooth with the pen I got.That was a bit disappointing.Overall I liked the laptop and it gives about 5 to 6 hours of battery backup.
"
"Simply love it
"
"It's as described. Ll write detailed after  some usage
"
"It is very slow for a i5 8th generation with ssd and 8gb ddr4. Also, it never gives 10 hours battery life per charge. I never got more than 4 to 5 hours that to on a power saving mode. Build quality, (especially keyboard and hinges for screen), is also very poor quality. Very very disappointed with this product so far. Hope this can be resolved.
"
"A must buy product. Totally satisfied with the quality and the features.
"
"Most recommend laptop in the price range.Boots in a flash.Multi tasking is very smooth.Fingerprint is a frequentl responser.Speakers are OK for a laptop.No heating issue faced even at extreme usage.

"
"This has everything you need, 256gb ssd for fast booting and processing as well as 1Tb HDD for storage. Display, in terms of viewing angle, and touch everything is awesome. Battery backup was around 5+ hours initially. Light weight, not feather light though, premium looks, solid build. The sound quality is awesome. The keyboards are in black(that is better) and not in silver finish as shown in pic. Go for it.
"
"Very good daily use laptop. Good specs and performance. Pre-installed office 2019 is a good addition and completes the basic requirements from a laptop.A good combination of hybrid drives where OS is on the SSD and storage can be used on the HDD. This gives higher data storage space at affordable price as well as faster performance.Overall a good product.
"
"All is positive!! Good product!!
"
"Pros:1. Lightweight and easy to carry everywhere.2. Decent battery life, (Not as mentioned 10 hrs though.)3. Perfect display,  It looks really cool with the highest brightness.Cons:1. Heat issues, which makes it difficult to use in tablet mode.2. Not so loudspeakers.
"
"Light weight and more work

"Everything but battery life is perfect. The battery drains even when the machine is shut which is not expected. Otherwise the look, finishing, portability, display quality all are even better than what I'd expected.
"
"The upper surface of the laptop is prone to scratch so better put a resistant.... overall the product is what it is expected to be functioning so far.
"
"Amazing laptop with high speed fast working. I suggest to all coustmer to buy this product and it's better than Mac or Dell.You can see more options and feature in this LAP. I'm very satisfied and it's very helpful to my software works.
"
"Early feedback - 256GB Flash Drive + 1TB HDD is great!  Mid-range quad-core CPU is a good choice. Had to go with built-in Intel-HD graphics (with UMA, it is a performance compromise) but chose this as it is 10K less than choosing an Nvidia card version. My needs are not for Gaming, so I do not expect any loss of performance.
"
"Over all a good package but I believe price is still high for this the key borad is basic with functions, build quality satisfactory, will update the rest after few months.
"
"Very premium laptop awesome battery life .. everything is just terrific
"
"The lack of additional GPU memory which is essential for fast and better rendering of images in this model, Heavy gaming and video editing is above its pay grade . But if not for that this laptop is best for office work as it has MS office ( Homre & Student) free with it and for professional writers and coders . As the screen is small i.e 13 inches enables this laptop to have excellent battery backup of minimum 5-6 hrs on wifi. It's light and the innovative design of hinge is just cherry on top. Screen shows awesome clearity as claimed so is the sound system. Finger print senser has few glitches. Keyboard feels good on fingers . Ports expands the functionality of unit, but the 2 USB ports are way too close and are on same side is quite unsettling. Overall it's a 13 inches piece of  awesomeness.
"
"This product specs is for around 50k laptop. Only one hard disk that too 128 gbssd. Atleat at 512 gb ssd. If you want to sell one on 65k.
"
"So you get specs from the spec sheet. Its 256gb ssd. Mine boots up in 10s , restarts in almost 30-40s.  Fingerprint reader is accurate but needs you to place the finger properly.. Screen is very good. Battery backup is descent. I've used it for 5-6 hrs on continous wifi and occasional YouTube with MSOffice and emailing (no gaming). The main attraction is its weight. And it can fit in a folder. It's very good for office goers who do not include in gaming. Also it heats up (not too much) and you can feel it. It doesn't heat up always. May be its during updates only. This is a very attractive piece. I got it for 61474 with bag, MS office 2019, McAfee 1 year subscription.

"There is nothing in this bag to say it a Laptop bag. This is a simple office bag. There is nothing to absorb the shock and prevent the Laptop from jerk and a little pressure. If i have to pay for a laptop bag then it should be specially designed for designed, but the company is making fool by giving a simple office bag with HP logo and telling it light weight laptop bag.I won't suggest any one to purchase it with an expectation of a ruf and tuf protective laptop bag.
"
"Slim and Stylish look
"
"perfect for my laptop.
"
"Wasnt expecting this kind of product from hp. It is below average. The thumb placing side is rubberized, it feels as if it is melting & keeps sticking to my thumb. Battery insering space is very poor. Was expecting a much more quality product. Also, the functionality of exta keys is uselss as they top thumb key strokes backward & bottom thumb key strokes forward (It should be opposite) and they are non programmable. Overall, not worth the money.. should not be more than Rs. 700-800 in current state. Also, there is no refund of this product, only replacement. That is real bad. I do not like it and am not abke to refund.. poor customer support

"It looks very good and stylish ,no need to say about bang and olufsen speakers ,splendid screen ,slim ,lighter than other gaming laptops, the keyboard is very good and it's customizable, fast booting ,and the gtx1050ti is sufficient for gaming along with 16gb ramOverall best lappy

"The 2019 HP Omen 15 (core i5 9th Gen) is a fantastic bag for the buck laptop. After using this laptop extensively for 3 months, I can truly say that it's price to performance ratio is just perfect and glides through everyday task with absolute ease.- Being a gaming laptop, it's funky styling may not be to everyone's taste, but one can definitely grow to love the well engineered edgy design, which is a real eye catcher out in public if you are into that kind of thing. The keyboard lighting is customizable too unlike other laptops at this price point, with a wife array of colours to choose from.- Coming to PERFORMANCE, it is important to understand that this is more of a base spec gaming laptop and can certainly not perform nearly as well and more expensive gaming laptops. But the new 9th gen processor, coupled the surprisingly powerful Nvdia GTX 1650, handles any game with very stable framerates and smooth enough gameplay. Being a photographer, I use this laptop a lot for editing videos and photos using Photoshop, Premier Pro, Lightroom and Resolve and it handles all of that real smoothly, through 4k videos take a little longer to be processed generally.(One thing to note is the fans, which do not have manual controls for their speeds in the dedicated Omen Control Panel. The only two settings to choose from is (1) 'CONFORT', which turns the fans on all the time to keep CPU and GPU temps at under 45°C, and (2) 'DEFAULT', which only kicks in if the temps pass around 60°C).- *BATTERY LIFE is also pretty decent considering its size, and if the display is set to medium brightness with the fans setting in 'default' mode along with the keyboard backlighting turned off, you can get around 3-4 hours of continuous video playback and around 2-3 hours of intensive tasks like editing photos and videos.- I though gamers might be disappointed with the lack of a 144hz SCREEN*, the 60hz panel this comes with is plenty sufficient and is sufficiently colour accurate. Plus the mat screen mate screen helps to keep reflections at a minimum.- Finally, talking about upgradability, there are 2 2666MHz DDR4 ram slots out of which one has the 8GB Samsung ram stick, a 2.5 inch hard drive and a Nvme M2 Ssd slot supporting upto 512GB.
"
"1660 would have been a good choice for hp omen 2019... Compare to 8th gen cpu 9th gen is not much improvement.... I would recommend to go for laptops with 1060 if you want to buy laptop at this range
"
"It's a good product when it's plugged in but when you are using it on battery power it drains faster.Positives - Processing Speed and GPUNegatives - Refresh Rate 60hz, BatterylifeIf you are buying this for gaming then look for better battery, because on battery power the graphics are optimized with medium settings. When it is plugged in the settings move to ultra in GeForce panel.If you have heating issues then try to update the bios in HP assistance. If you cannot find an option to update the bios, then reset the PC once and then update all the settings in HP assistance you can see Bios update there.If don't update the Bios the system temperature will be around 85 to 90 and fan noise will be horrible. If you update the Bios the temperature will be around 45 - 55Final opinion, it's better to go with previous model 2018 HP Omen because of the 144hz refresh rate, which offers almost same performance. Don't buy this for gaming alone because the battery life is poor.
"
"Just bought it recently and loved it. My editing software works great. Haven't tested any games though because I'm not into gaming much. Softwares like Adobe After Effects, Photoshop, Premiere pro run smoothly and no lag issues .Temperature gets high at a times but UPDATING THE BIOS fixed the problem.Overall a Great Product.
"
"Bought this a couple of days ago. Right out of the box the system couldn't detect the Nvidia GPU. I updated the driver etc. But nothing worked. After some time the Nvidia drivers disappeared from the device manager. Trying a clean reinstall if windows now. Hopefully it works. Total pain in the ass.
"
"I bought this laptop and rest is good. But after connecting with wifi its is disconnecting itself I refered this problem with hp they ask me to do number of workouts like disable the driver etc but after all its not working at the endPerformance wise is goodGaming is good
"
"Some background - I am a design student in the final year of my Bachelor's Degree. I have big use for software like Adobe Illustrator, XD and sometimes Photoshop and/or InDesign. Previously, I was using a 4-year-old HP which would take more time to boot up than me completing my Graduation. I HAD to switch to something more reliable and powerful. Also, video-games matter to me.What's my primary use?- Design Software (no 3-D Modelling, all 2-D)- Casual Gaming- Reading and Typing (its a big thing for me)Now, in this budget range, a lot of people would suggest buying something from Asus or MSI since they give you more value for money. But Omen's Design is what made me fall in love with it and I will elaborate on that part more than anything else.The body is sleek, making efficient use of it's weight. Laptops in this range always tend to feel bulky and look even worse. They feel like 'portable gaming rigs' instead of a laptop. When I carry this one around, people are struck in awe, impressed by how well the laptop fits in your lap/on a table and well the keyboard and touchpad feel; considering the laptop is has heavy specs. All this mattered the most for me. HP has not compromised when it comes to design and you can clearly see that here.Now, the gaming bit - I cannot complain about the frame-rates or graphics card since the games I play are mostly Indie or casually competitive. Most of my gaming happens on a PS4, so.Still, here are the games I have been running on High/Ultra settings which work flawlessly:- Rainbow Six: Siege- Kingdom Come Deliverence- Fortnite- PUBG- The Elder Scrolls Online- AstroneerOther than that, I haven't tried running hardcore AAA titles (exception - Ghost Recon: Breakpoint BETA which ran very well). The battery life however is mediocre (4-6 hours on average) but I mostly use the laptop on charge. I say, put your faith in HP and go for this one - won't let you down.
"
"Since it is 4k display so display refresh rate is 60hz. So if wanna play Shadow of tomb raider, Witcher 3 like game superb laptop, but if you wanna play game like PUBG, Fortnite then it may not be good option for you. Since i play both types of game in this laptop "" I don't  fell any lack of perfomance since it have G - sync"" I do play fortine which give me 40 fps( Single channel) in epic setting in 4k resoultion which is good enough.  No performance doubt it a beast.
"
"The screen is lovely and the 144Hz refresh rate makes competitive shooters fluid. The heating is a little but problematic for high CPU intense tasks, but overall the zone rgb lightning along with 6core i7 that stays at 3ghz nearly all the time makes it a most buy under 1.15 lakhs.
"
"The laptop is great for gaming, no thermal issues till now, boot time is 3-5 seconds, looks premium, keys are also good.I have only tried Apex Legends yet which runs at a steady 60+ fps on low (I have kept everything low for highest framerate possible) with frame drops if there is too much going on in the environment. Fan noise is also minimal and hardly heard.I have also dual booted the system because I need Linux for work purposes and Linux also runs great.But the main thing is battery which I feel doesn't last long(ik gaming laptop).A full charge takes about 1:30-2 hours and 3-4 hours for discharge with lowest brightness and keyboard lights turned off.
"
"I have been using this laptop from last 2 month here is my review :A laptop with i7 and Nvidia 1050ti it is fast. I am a DotA2 and lol player I am getting 140 fps avg on high graphics settings in both games.In starting this laptop has some serious heating issues but after bios update it is working pretty good. Peak temperature of this laptop after bios update is 89 degree after 5-6 hrs of gaming and my laptop got there only one time, the avg temperature of gaming is 75 so don't worry.Battery life is good currently it is giving 2hr in normal usage.Bonus:  a thunderbolt 3 port which makes this laptop future proof.Overall this laptop is beast in this price range.
"
"I am using Laptop for almost a month. Didn't face any issue in day to day tasks. While. Playing heavy games there is bit of sluggish due to ram which is 8 GB.Display is goodBattery performance is goodKeyboard is great with backlightGraphic is goodSuggestions :- install an additional 8 GB of RAM. It will give you smooth performance in game also. I have tried it out.
"
"I have been using this laptop for past few weeks. The performance is great. Games such as wildlands and pubg runs easily on high settings with v sync off .One thing though its better if u check the price at ur nearest retail store i got mine for 98k.

"It's a maxq design for GPU not a regular rtx 2070. Performance is similar to a gtx 1070 mobile version. However coupled with gsync display performance is awesome. That hot cpu can be addressed by undervolting.

"Laptop is great at best price but only problem it has only single channel meomery. All of the vendors such as Asus,Dell,Acer,msi all are providing rtx 2070 max q laptop with single channel meomery.if you want to get full advantage of this beast graphics card you must have dual channel meomery which can be easily upgrade as most of the games use dual channel meomery however changing ram is tedious not as difficult as msi because it need to swap motherboard but hp has very tight bottom panel. I will recommend go to hp store and buying adata 16gb lpddr4 2400mhz variant . They will also assemble ram for free. It will also prevent your warranty.
"
"Nice Laptop with good specs, but could have been more value for money if there was GTX 1660 GPU and 120 or 144Hz Display, looks premium and well built
"
"I was about to buy this laptop and the price just increased to 16k , very disappointing. Giving that the laptop doesn't  have a SSHD and even the graphic card  is maxq version. The RGB light's on the keyboard are divided into 4 zone which is a good way of cost cutting and making it budget friendly but now as the price has increased it is sure a negative point now. It's not worth buying for more than 1,66,000.
"
"What deadly performance in small sizeBest display, best thermal design, good speaker, beast rtx 2060,thunderbolt port,vr ready,good chassis, best hinge, windows precision trackpad, most excellent keyboard
"
"Pros : Screen (144Hz + Thin Bezels), Keyboard Lighting (Can be customised with many colors), Design, Built quality.Games : FIFA 18, Fortnite can be played at High Graphic settings with smooth performance.Cons : PUBG can be played with Mid Graphic settings. High Graphic settings does not support smooth performance.Overall HP OMEN DC0082tx and family can be considered in the top 3 gaming laptops of 2018.
"
"For all those who write that it's not worth it, let me tell u that it has a 4k monitor along with 144hz refresh rate!!!!!!!! So 1,66,000 is worth spending!!!!!!!! Also the this version of omen has better heat balance than its predecessors!!!!!!!
"
"1. Excellant heat management2. 144 Hz ref rate3. Beautiful 4K display4. High fidelitySo yeah worth it!
"
"very good laptop at its price but 144hz display does not go with 1050ti if it would be 1060 6gigs then this would be unbeatable  at its price.(witcher 3 ❌❌)And all knows about its heating issues we cannot control fan speed maybe hp could look into that like its competitors.Overall 144hz just wow

"Don't buy any Omen series laptops from here....go to Croma... I just bought one from Croma...first of all incredibly overpriced here on amazon....so overpriced that I wasn't even considering Omen series even though I'm an HP fan....secondly got 10% Axis bank discount and goodies included a bag, a Logitech gaming mouse,keyboard, mousepad(some Sims4 special edition shit) + a VIP strolley...all amounting to 10k...all in all I got benefits worth 25k (the discount + the goodies) My specs are i7 8750H/RTX2060 6GB/1TB+256SSD/16GB(I guess the same product) and it was priced at 1.51...I got it for 1.34 + goodies...the price went from reasonable to cheap very easily
"
"I bought this Laptop, however after using for a month, i will say, forget the latest games like 2019 games etc, even if u play 2015 games on lowest settings, this Laptop heats. I have air conditioned room and also place the Laptop on Cooler Master Cooling Pad, still it heats, secondly Fan noise is too high while u play games. What is the use of tagging gaming laptop, when it cannot withstand the older version of games on lowest settings.
"
"I bought it from a local seller for 1.17lac with the back pack free. This thing is actually a Beast when it comes to laptop gaming. 144hz montior with the Nvidia 1050ti slays each and every game. It also has a Thunderbolt 3 port which is actually good for this range. Trust me this is the best lappy right now.
"
"Best value for the buck. RTX-2070 is has 5x speed and gtx1070 has 3x speed. Can be easily boostedThe only problem is the CPU I7-8750H, it cannot be overclocked but still a very powerful CPU
"
"This Laptop is Simply Awesome! I bought this in Nov 19 at 1,07,500 ! Everything is Fine except it heats up little bit and fan noise is quite high ! That Fine edge and Stylish Look admired me a lot to buy this! Coming up with performance , this Lap works fine at any level of computing ! Yeah , I recommend this 💙
"
"Lightweight n portable.average fps during game: 70-80game like battlefield 5. you can also play it on ultra but you will get 40-30fps.biggest disadvantage you can't use it one your lap😂Note: It heats up like anything but that's not a problem if you use a external keyboard n mouse!

"The look is not so great but i installed both win 8.1 and win 10 easily though i had to completely format the hard disk (and thus deleting HP 2- page manual given with dos)-both win 8.1 and win 10 automatically identified all drivers and no driver installation was required (wi fi, audio, vedio, display everything). I do extensive data editing and graph in origin and also mat lab and those were very fast so far (i purchased on 14th October). Overall good laptop at a very low cost with exchange.offer .pros-1) good speed-no hanging in data editing calculation graph making, typing, etc. 2) audio and video output are good, 3) good battery back up and fast charging, 4) no heating issue after 4-5 h continuous usecons-1)ordinary look, 2) up and down arrow very close,  3) relative position of power button  and light indicator , showing power is on is awkward. 3) Unlike acer, asus , in hp site drivers are not easy to download and in my case after putting my laptop sl no hp could not identify my machine and thus i could not download any driver.
"
"This a very basic laptop with I have bot in exchange of my Think Pad for 7500 and paid 16000 for this HP laptop is is not worthy. Main disadvantage with is it comes with DOS Operating system. I purchased a License very Windows 7 pro and installed. But non of the drivers will load and I struggled for 3 days to load drivers. It will not work for windows 7. So I have complained to AMAZON they have sent me the technical person for inspection but he said there is no hardware problem and refused for further action stating that it came with Dos version and he cannot help for return. I spent another 500rs with local technician but no use but finally he have fixed the wifi drivers thru that I had to upgrade to windows 10 pro. But the system is very slow.Dont buy HP laptops which are cheaper in prices go for laptops above 40k in HP. Built quality is very cheap so  cheap the touch pad resonates when Taping on the touch pad.I will compare this laptop with non big brands like iball or Ausus etc...I had no option so I gave this laptop to my kids for there use.
"
"good product against price and you need to update with windows 10 so that no issue of drivers arise.good quality of connectivity all WiFi Bluetooth all easy to use as it compact with too perfect hd display look is nice  , after all its low budget perfect laptop for office and home use best for this price offer.

"I bought this with lots of doubts whether it will serve my daily office work which is related to browsing the internet and trust me past 3 days im using it after installing Windows 10 pro everything is just smooth no lags.Yes its definitely not a high end laptop so for this price its ok. The dvd drive looks very cheap and even feels like its made of thin plastic.Thats all

"After installing windows 10 everything is fine but wifi is not working.. In the item description it is shown that system is equipped with wifi but still there is no icon coming for wifi. Even after installing driver for wifi which is though not required but still i tried and result is same..
"
"Specs wise a very good deal for the price of 21-22k. Sound quality average through speakers. However, good and loud audio through the headphone jack.Good for everyday tasks such as browsing, streaming and working on MS Office.Games of 2010-2011 might work on low settings.Good screen size of 15.6 inches is ideal for movies.However, sometimes lag is noticable especially after windows has finished updating. (Any budget processor like this will experience that at this price range. Not a major worry)
"
"Received the laptop last week and it has a serious manufacturing defect. The screen of the laptop doesn't move ahead from this HP logo and after trying numerous times to install os windows 10 it failed and gets hang..Know what! (The laptop doesn't get shut down) And hangs every other minute..to add salt to injury Amazon service guys say we don't replace/ return , absolutely unconcerned and disrespectful.. stuck with a manufacturing defective laptop and 21k gone down the drain.. never buy from Amazon because only God can save you if you are stuck

"THIS PRODUCT IS NOT THE EXACT PRODUCT THAT IS MENTIONED ON AMAZON.The packaging is so poor. But overall I am happy with this laptop. The specification is wrong on this specification details as well.1st of all, It's 4GB graphics2. RAM is 8GB, 4GB x 2, but the extended RAM is 16GB supported. So you need to change both of the RAMs to get it 163. Headphone and mic is having same port. So the port is actually a 2-in-one port. So you can use any mobile headphones which is wrongly describe as well4. HDMI IS ONLY 1. ON THE DESCRIPTION SAYS, 2 NOS OF HDMI. So make sure, before purchase, the HDMI port is not 2, but it's only one5. Charger is pretty fast.6. Picture is crisp and clear as well7. The card reader is having some issue. It's changing the  read-write switch state when I am inserting the cardOverall rating :Design: 8/10Quality: 7.5/10Durability: 8.5/10Picture quality: 9/10System stability (OS): 7.5/10Performance: 7.5/10I AM VERY SAD, BECAUSE THIS DELIVERY I HAVE RECEIVED IN A VERY VERY BAD WAY. SELLER NEVER USED ANY BUBBLE WRAPPING. LAPTOP WAS SLIDING INSIDE THE PACKAGEING. GOT SCRATCH AS WELL. VERY UNHAPPY IF THEY ARE GOING TO SHIP PRODUCT LIKE THIS. THAT IS THE ONLY REASON OF MY 3 STAR. OTHERWISE I WOULD HAVE GIVEN 4 STAR.

"Bought it from HP store. It's a great laptop. Will never let you down. And the price there was 99990
"
"This model number is described as omen 15 ax252tx but in hp site there is no laptop with model number how can i trust buying it online its price came around  80k at flipkart
"
"The laptop is working good but the battery life is poor
"
"The spec of laptop is awesome and the features too & there is bit problem of battery but use properly then it long last.
"
"The hinge mechanism is unique and it will be interesting to see whether it holds up well as there are only 2 tiny rubber pads that support the laptop when open. It's fast and responsive and charges pretty fast. Expect a battery life of around 4 hours on medium/light usage. The trackpad is smooth and very responsive. The screen is anti glare and the speakers are fairly loud and clear.
"
"Awesome laptop... loved it
"
"I hope from deep of my heart that, no one will buy this laptop at this "" HIGH PRICE ""....Great Laptop At GREAT GREAT HIGH PRICE...I prefer to say ""Just Don't Buy""
"
"Outstanding Laptop...I had purchased it 1 month ago and it is amazing...Handles each and everything very smoothly...Only one con is there,that when you play heavy games then battery drains very fastly other than that it is excellent...
"
"Other specs are good, but there are two drawbacks:-The battery life is very bad :( I mean if you just normally browse, it will give you just 4Hrs (max) of battery backup .The second one is WiFi problem. i.e most of the time you will have to connect with your WiFi manually, it won't connect automatically.
"
"I suggest you to don't buy this product .Quality of the product is totally worst and the packing is totally bad. This is totally wastage of money.
"
"Bag is good best quality bag

"Best one

"Charger has stopped charging the battery. It is now working as electricity supplier only.  Product has malfunctioned within a month !!! Dont know if there is any way to return/replace it.

"Duplicate product

"Does not work with company 630
"
"Very good replacement part. Genuine product.
"
"Pros: Delivered in time. Setup is easy. Liked Mobile app feature. Did test prints and satisfied. Got full volume of ink in default print cartridges, which are 680 series. These cost RS 1150 as combo, for kind information to co-custumers.Cons: The power socket was wobbling, a poor design. But I managed with a tape inside so it holds good. This is on the down side.Caution: Any printer goes for a toss as the time passes because of dust accumulation. I had the experiences of dysfunction of wifi connection, double side printing, paper injection mechanism etc. This is my 4th printer in series. Bought printer cover as well because for me dust control is top priority given the worst experiences in the past.Value for money at the price of RS 5999/. Flipkart sells at RS 4999 or 5199. Amazon should compete here.Trust the above helps.
"
"Print quality is good but the cartridge performace is so poor. Just print 75 paper and cartridge  empty.
"
"My cartridge ink is over within a week, I have not taken even 100 prints also. Never used color as well. Bad quality cartridge. False promise on the number of prints it gives.
"
"Got the product with no cartridge and with one used cartridge in machine where black was empty and color was half.....also packing of old quality as if used piece
"
"This is the position of the catridge after just one print. Totally dissatisfied with the catridge quality. Installation is way too easy. Printing directly from smartphone is also easy. Nice product but useless catridges.
"
"Everything is perfect like built quality, installation.  but page output per cartridge not even a half of the mentioned number. You can say it prints only 1/4th of the mentioned numbers. I will suggest buy some other printer. Don't go for reviews. Don't know whether they are paid or fake but they are not genuine reviews.
"
"Bought this product absolutely two months back, Now i am getting a error msg on the screen Cartridge is not compatible with this printer, and when i talk to the Hp Customer care and this is one of the worst customer support that they got. They are asking me to buy a new Cartridge, Very Funny.......Simple Words, Only worth for Two Months, If you got an extra day or Month you are very lucky.....Worst Product, and More Worst Customer Support...
"
"Easy to handling and good connectivity throught WiFi and Easy to install and good product to use and maintain easy. Category also 680/- RS something, both black nd white and colour
"
"Nice printer for home use at this price. Printing speed is little bit slow however for home use it's manageable. Overall printing quality is good.I am not sure how much prints we can get from one set of cartridge but as of now we took 50 prints and still the cartridge showing 75%.
"
"This is a nice product and belonging to a good and believable company HP that gives us a very good value for the money and it is also a good product but not that very good product but a satisfying product for the money*The device is very easy to use. Even if you have less technical experience, we estimate that you will get along quickly with the device. If need be, the simple manual can help you.*I tested the HP Deskjet 3636 without any expectations and are pleasantly surprised. Scanners, printers, copiers; easy handling; Good scan and print quality as well as a particularly attractive, low price. The running costs are the only drawback, which, however, probably goes with most inkjet printers.*Judging by the low price, the HP Deskjet 3636 is a very good product. Noble design, easy operation and many features for little money.
"
"I received a very  cheap quality printer as i used only for one time second time it was not getting on, as I came to know  that mother board is out of service,worst! pls think before buying it.
"
"Very poor quality product. The printer was making loud noise and yesterday its stop working. I hardly printed 10 sheets. Yesterday when I was trying to Print a page i found its making a loud noise and on opening the front panel i found that cartridge was banging left and right and then came the shock i found two pieces of a platstic strip. On research i found it is called encoder strip. I am frustrated and don't know how to fix it.
"
"Althoughh the printer is very good, the promised extra black cartridge has not been sent along with the printer.the gift voucher of Rs. 1000/- which can be used in BATA  and other outlets not enclosed. Please arrange for immediate compliance.
"
"Not see
"
"So far good prints. Didn't use high quality paper till now so can't give any review on that. 80 gsm paper prints are good. Good for school projects. Loving the scanner. Document feeder is a relief when scanning multiple papers. Photocopy print quality is manageable, definitely not great. Great thing is any material can be scanned, ofcourse that shouldn't exceed A4 size and shouldn't be sharp. I scanned the front of a purse and it came out very nice.
"
"Got the delivery in 2 days. It was nicely packed. Received  2  black cartridges and 1 Tri-colour cartridge with printer. Using this printer for past 30days; scan, Color print b&w print, photocopy everything working seamlessly. Never tried printing through usb cable. Used only wireless for all print n scan. Who needs usb cable when u can do everything wirelessly. Best printer for personal use.
"
"I was confused with Canon pixma E560 and HP 3835 but after searching all reviews and HP support system I bought HP. Only disadvantage with this is that it does not have auto duplex feature. But other good features like print speed/no. pages weigh down that disadvantage. Go for it if you are looking for long term, home/small office use wireless printer.
"
"Product is really good but No extra Black ink included
"
"The product looks good and also i dont have any complain for quality but the issue is with the cost per print, i have installed 3 sets of cartridges and in one set not able to print more than 15 - 17 pages, so its better not to print anything on this, its a showcase product for me now... i strongly suggest not to but this product
"
"Good product but connecting online with devices is bit of challenge. It appears apple devices synced very fast but windows taking time.
"
"I bought it around 3 weeks ago, and found it really useful and up to the good standards. So far no problem. HP Smart print app enables print from anywhere. Dedicated printer email id enables me to print anything by sending the document to hpeprint.com email address.The size of the printer was a little larger than I expected, but that's fine. Also, not sure if anyone uses Fax these days.Overall a good buy.
"
"Print quality is great, very easy to install and operate but within two months of purchase the document feeder stopped working. Without document feeder we cannot copy legal size paper. This ghe major flaw I have faced using this printer otherwise ig is great.
"
"Scanner and copier feature was not working but printing was just fine. After many hours of troubleshooting, including with HP tech support, I was told that technician will have to visit. Unable to schedule time with technician, after 2 days, I decided to take the product to HP auth service centre, where with just one copy and scan, they tagged it Dead On Arrival... meaning a defective piece. Returned the product as Amazon had very constrained rules on replacement -it has to be the same product from same seller and within 10 days and product was not in stock. I was on the 9th day by the time I figured this all out. Overall, quite a  bad experience with both HP and Amazon. Amazon customer service experience was not good at all.
"
"1 Printer Cartridge will print ~80-100 pages(one side only) only and that too when we took print in Economic mode, Plus if you try any hack to refill cartridge...It would not work at all. Every time you have to buy cartridge of Rs. 650-750 range... If u r ready to spend Rs. 8-10 per page(single side) you can go for it. They are earning money by selling highly priced cartridges and low cost printers...It is a trap..Don't buy, our most regretted shopping ever.
"
"Very easy to use and super comfortable. Even a 5 year old can print by its own. Very fast printing wirelessly. Although it takes much more time when printing from phone via wired otg. Hp smart app is handy for printing via phone...but it is little complicated to print pdfs from this app.
"
"Scanning via Auto Document Feeder scans random parts of the page. No solution from HP support till date. This is an inherent flaw in this model that HP knows about since many years and has still not fixed it. You can see several threads about this problem in the HP forums, just google it. Other than this issue it works fine
"
"It's been exactly two months since I've purchased it... I'd not recommend it for colour prints since this really has too many issues. What I mean is that investment is really too high to what you get in return! Though I'd like to mention that the black and white print outs are Good and it is easy to install and use once you get it installed in all the aspects! I'd rather suggest everyone reading my review to invest in some ink tank printer cause it would be a one time investment and returns would be good!
"
"A great printer. Scans well, prints fast, works good online and offline. Connectivity options are best. The best part is the email id of the printer. We can send the documents via email directly to the personal email id of printer and it prints automatically.The problem is with the direct wifi connection. Prints takes too much time or often fails to print incase of wifi direct connection.Second thing which should be improved is the mobile app of the printer. App only shows some specific folders of internal storage. There is no option to find the documents stored in sd card memory. I can say app is a disaster while compared to printer functions.And yes, i like the touch screen as well.
"
"Printer is extremely slow even from Laptop via WIFI. It takes ages to print. Want to get it replaced or corrected.Any help ? It does not respond at times and looks a complete waste of money.
"
"Overall I am satisfied with this product. Did not check print quality for an image.Pros1. Value for money in this price range2. Easy to install3. Looks great4. Touch displayCons1. Copy quality is not sharp2. Eprint feature is not easy to configure. You need to assign static IP on your printer to use this feature.3. “Print anywhere” feature is not available on this model. The HP smart app on the mobile detects printer only on home network where the printer is available.
"
"Very good printer at such cost by hp but the ink is somewhat costly as per printing cost.also if printer is not used for some days then paper jams occur.
"
"After day 1 use- very easy installation,good print quality and speed.print from mobile also posibble after installing free app from google store.pls view installation video from youtube if u want to self install.
"
"2 days after buying the product i m facing printing issue for which i tried to contact to HP service care but they are just saying that , your call will be transferred to so called senior. and after that i waited for half an hour then they disconnect the call. this happens every time.when i asked that why u r not connecting after tranfering the call then they replied that its not my problem.who is responsible for it?now i will take some leagal action against it if i will not be served within 2 days.
"
"Purchased this product over a month ago, during the last sale. The produce was well packaged and delivered promptly. Installation took a while, especially if you don't have a CD-drive and have to install from the web. After installation thought, it is very easy to use. However, after a month's use and about 35 pages of print, the laptop stopped color prints while color prints from the mobile gave yellow printouts.The customer service was the worst, even after over an hour of staying on calls, they werent able to solve either of the issues. I was able to solve the laptop issue by reinstalling all drivers manually, which took some time. A complaint was finally raised to send a technician for a site visit. The tech person came after a couple of days, tried the same steps but couldn't solve. Per the technician, the red color nozzle had dried out and this is common in inkjet printers if not used every 3 days!!
"
"Wireless connectivity with Laptop is a big issue. After 3 days also I could not connect it to my Sony Laptop. My laptop shows the printer, but printer is not functioning wireless even after connection. Rest other functions are good. For Print quality I can give 7 out of 10 points, because I have used HP printer before this also of lower price range the print quality was more crispe, may be it is because of paper we use. But overall a good printer
"
"When I tried to setup the product, the supplied cartridges were not recognised by the printer. Ultimately I landed up calling  HP Customer Care , who in turn connected me to a technician who performed troubleshooting over the phone ---- and finally came to a conclusion that the black cartridge was faluty. So I was asked to take the cartridge to the HP Service Centre, which I visited today. The Service Centre has taken the cartridge and said that they will courier a new one to my home sometime next week.So firstly I get a faulty product , and then Customer Service is likely to take a week to send me a replacement cartridge !!!!Also please note that the product description on amzon sys that there is ""1 set of cartridge (1 black & 1 colour ) additional free in box"" .... However there was only one additional black cartridge in the box. So don't be fooled !!!
"
"The printer is very good. Quality of print is nice. Installation is very easy as well. You will get lots of vedio in YouTube related to installation. One issue is that if you try to scan multiple documents at one go from top, the scanned pdf gets most of the images and data cropped. This issue is being reported by multiple user and whatever workaround given by HP didn't not work. So basically the multiple image scanning at one go functionality was not properly tested by HP before the product release. But if you are scanning individual document by opening the copier lid, it works fine.Apart no other issue. Printer is awesome for home use.
"
"I purchased HP Deskjet 3835 All-in-One printer from Amazon 2 months ago and my review is based on my experience what I got from it.Pros-I myself installed the product and I had no problem installing that as I got irritating people printed with manual.Pages printing qualities superb and decent timing is taken to print a page.It is good for home purposes.(My opinion-you can go this for this printer it's good pages printing quality is also excellent .It can scan copy fax its wireless also can use it through mobile also using its app available on play store).@3999Cons-ink is little bit getting drained.
"
"The printer is amazing. Installation is online and very easy. Print commands can be given from any device (android, windows, ipad) provided connected in the same network. It is Alexa compatible. You have to enable HP printer skill in Alexa and you are all set to print your shopping list, puzzles, games etc. Hp also gives a UDB cable to connect to PC or laptop, just incase there is no network. The print quality is very good even in draft mode. Pre-programmed printables like check-list, ruled page, columns & rows etc. are available. Only con about this is the cost of the ink cartridge. Small pack (combo) itself costs around ₹2500.
"
"First I would not prefer you to buy this unless and until you know some basic technical aspects of connection. Every time you want to print a paper there will be a trail paper run by the printer which takes all the colour in use and this will be irritating . I would want you to be more concerned if you need really a printer at this age of life .....
"
"Printer is awesome. Good quality pictures and printing speed is normal. Can print from mobiles is a good feature. Some cons are like scanning in default resolution is not of good quality. ADF scanning sometimes faulty. Flatbed scanning is good. Packing by the seller not upto mark. No Amazon prime packaging.
"
"The product images does not show that the paper feed tray is a pull out behind the printer. It projects out and gets in the way of putting a printer cover on it.The printer goes offline quickly and the drivers need to reconnect. Because of this the whole process of printing a document of scanning takes time.It works better if it is connected via USB rather than on WiFi.
"
"Overall a good printer for small day to day printing, what I didn’t like was it takes 2 pages together while printing one page, so I have to hold the second page and then leave it later, would get very difficult if a large printing job needs to be done
"
"Since I after buying it I feel some one need who is expert but since even then I got to know how the twin side printing is from social media like YouTube but product will goes on performance is awesome and other thing is to mention that I saw user manual is printed little bit in English and most used language is in some other languageHethere again i am chetan and as i need to tell you is this printer has came with no defect but i need to cum to know is about its catridge is only about to 17-20mls of ink hence it does took a 10-20 days to get empty and its price is too costly is 850/- to 950/- each for each which contains 20ml only so then its too costly and you get 43-55rupees for each 'ml' of in in catridge else quite ""GOOD"" product manifacturers done 'GOOD' efforts and taken 'NO COMPROMISE' with 'Quality' any how you can goto official site to get proper tutorials  Thanks for reading my comment and i wish it made good review to make good decision
"
"If you can go for ink tank printer... Cartilages are really expensive and hp manipulate the ink levels... Photo printing quality is inconsistent with premium paper as well.. Of you print to many photos then better go for tank printers in long run they are worth your penny
"
"Not at all satisfied in terms of printer cartridge. Not more than 30 pages I printed and black cartridge is finished. Colour cartridge is also near to finish. Moreover, even if paper is loaded, printer sensor is not able to detect the same and ask for loading the paper.
"
"Very useful for home use. Love the wireless connectivity for printing directly from a smart phone.
"
"After using the 3830 extensively, got this. The usual HP issues with the cartidges being short on ink and running out just when you need them the most is present in this as well. What peeved me the most was the intermittent and unreliable printing over direct Wi-Fi or over the home network. Perhaps it's my printer, or something else.Why buy this? Document feeder for scanner. If you need to scan multiple pages, the document feeder is valuable feature.Also, re-filled cartidges can be used if needed. Don't go with the rated prints, you'll get about 150-200 B&W pages on the regular 640 cartridge and 120-130 pages on the color.
"
"It's amazing except the fact that it's too huge for the functionality.Automatic document feeder is a nice assistance in making copiesHP allows you to connect to a router and they could let you setup a email address where you can send your PDFs and it will print automatically from the server !Always use HP original cartridge for Best Print Quality!
"
"Speed on wifi direct is pretty slow.Ink gets over after 250 pgs.I have not received the assured gift as promise. Have sent all courier as prescribed.
"
"Good AIO for the price paid. Received 2 Black cartridges but both are setup cartridges and 1 Tricolor cartridge. Easy to operate and Wifi connectivity and Mobile connectivity are a big advantage.
"
"The printer can be operated wireless from your phone as well as laptop. In Linux, the printer was auto-detected as it was in the same network and I was able to use it. The installation steps are pretty easy to follow through. The print quality is good, almost natural. The scanning and I'd scan facility is pretty good. Only downfall is that for two sided printing you will have to feed the odd sided printed papers once more. Other than that I believe it is a good printer for the the price.My parents found the UI pretty simple to use and I am happy for that as well.
"
"Prints fast, good quality. A breeze to set up. Strongly recommend. Works in Windows & Ubuntu. Got an extra black cartridge with regular set of black + colour. Haven't tried the flat bed scanner but it's included in this AiO. It's not too big and fairly light in weight.Some minor issues have come up with initial use. Paper sizing alerts keep popping up for some reason. The paper tends to get caught on the upper lip of the out tray.Wireless via WiFi network is a bit difficult to manage settings, with mobile browsers not accepting the site. Was easier to switch back to USB for now.
"
"It is always showing ""printer validation failed""
"
"Missing Spare Black Cartridge as promised under product specification
"
"Had a lot of questions/worries at time of purchasing this all-in-1 printer. Surprisingly all questions were answered at time of installing this printer self.Able to install cartridges.Able to install/connect to wifi.Able to setup through mobile, laptop.Able to update software easily.Hope printer will sustain as per this
"
"Printer is easy to install and easy to use. B&W prints are quick but it takes quite long time of around ~10 mints for colour prints. Print quality of colour print is not up to the expectations as compared to B&W print quality. Colour Cartridge was also not full tank when received with printer.
"
"Worst product ever. Dont go for it. It is impossible to install. Dont buy from amazon atleast
"
"Printer is not working
"
"Got a used printer in first delivery. It was missing CD and RJ45 cable in the package. It also had printing issues. Replaced it and the new one seems to be brand new. Working fine so far....Print quality is good. Easy to use. HP Smart app is good
"
"Good printer. Working good even on wifi. Cartridge provided is only for demo. Won’t give as many prints promised. Would request HP to improve there software/app. Give more print templates for daily use.
"
"Don't bye this for Xerox print cost 1.5 per pages
"
"Installation is time consuming but there are various options like remote printing via internet and wifi direct . Scanner is a bit slow but ok for home use. Initially had paper jamming issues but now settled . The papers should be extremely dry even the humidity during rainy season causes paper jamming issues.
"
"My personal advice please don't buy this product very poor quality..as as well as very very bad customer service (HP care  Wipro limited ,c/o skypro technologies Pvt .Ltd  flat No 29 ,door No8,3rd cross ,sithanandha Nager,Ellaipillaichavady,pondy-605005 )only one month I use this printer after some motor wire cut I said I have warranty one year .the  service centre said some Cockroach go inside cut the wire ..fully cheating .. please don't go this product mainly thiruvannamalai District people .. because you will also get same service centre ..they are cheating.. service engineer name( Dinesh)
"
"Great product delivered before time by Amazon and Apario retail. It comes with complementary installation and demo. But HP customer service is absolutely HORRIBLE. It's managed by Wipro. I would suggest you to install it yourself as it's pretty easy and there are several videos on YouTube to help you out with that.
"
"Happy with the product. Although the printing is slower than expected. But the quality is good and the ink doesn't get used up quickly. Good for home and small business use.
"
"This is a great product. It allows me to print from internet and mobile over wireless, has excellent print quality, very easy to use, install and troubleshoot for small problems, lastly has the ability to scan and xerox multiple pages with one click
"
"Complete and utter garbage.The feed 'tray' for paper is non existent. Its just a slot - that is too small - through which you stick in a few papers at a time. You will be lucky to print a page or two out of this craptastic piece of junk before it jams.Ofc - too late to return it. Will need to figure out how to dispose the darn thing. Will donate it to anyone that needs a scanner. Printing and copying of course are out of the question.HP - you suck and I hate you!
"
"It's value for money. Product is going awesome till now. I printed lot of color print as well as  black & white. But somewhat cartilage refilling instructions missing . I would suggest supplier should provide instructions to how much to refill ink in cartilage. Printing quality good. Somewhat need to provide proper instructions how to use that part is missing
"
"I suggest to buy this printer.It is cheap and is multi functioned.It has an automatic document feeder for scanner.and it also use one of the cheapest ink cartridge.only duplex printing is not there, who cares.Just it's ""AWESOME"".
"
"It printes well, but exactly a week after I purchased it started giving a ""carriage jam""eror.Since this was a brand new printer and absolutely no jam, checked all the support videos and could not get rid of the error.HP support sucksand for a brand new printer giving programatic errors , this was not a good purchase
"
"Very good...I liked d product and only if the no of  pages that can be printed could increase.
"
"The catridge which comes with the printer has very low ink and I was advised to refill as the company gives low ink for testing purpose only...Even when i refil i can take only 50-60 copies and i refilled 4 times in a month
"
"Very user friendly, easy to install and use. Bought it for my 12 year old child for school assignments n projects. He uses it himself with ease and it serves the purpose for home printing, scanning and photocopying.
"
"I ordered it today only one single coloured print I have taken and it is showing ink bottle only with one bar. Scanner not working, tried many time to take xerox.. Don't know how amazon is going to solve this problem. Expected a lot from others reviews posted here. But now totally stuck up. With money and time
"
"Have been using for about a month... Good printer, but strangely colour is printing as b/w. Have looked at the settings and not finding any options.Print quality is good, and options and great. Scan works well.
"
"Installation of printer was good and easy going. Print,copy and scan activities all working good. Cartridge installation is easy, only worried about how many pages will it last. Wireless configuration done with my smart phone.Well I give 5stars on this.Can someone provide a HP printer service center number and address for my other HP printer?
"
"As usual, one needs to install lot of bloated HP apps on your phone to get this to work with WIFI.I am surprised why HP cannot use Android's inbuilt functionality and provide a single light weight app for wireless printing.
"
"It prints like max 30 pages with one ink cartridge.  It's very expensive to refill it every now and then. Not value for money
"
"Easy to install. It automatically detect the paper,it's a good feature and also has all the features. previously I bought a HP DeskJet 7275 printer it was the baddest printer on AmazonIt's been 10 working fine for now.

"4 star for this printer because for color print provide less than 40 pages and by judging price it'll be costly per page rate.I'll suggest you local ink, your printer will go out of warranty but it will be cost efficient.
"
"Great product, The item was delivered quickly, and it was easy to set up. The 'e-mail to print"" function is great and it allows me to print documents at home from anywhere in the world. Great for a home office setup, with its scanning and printing function.

"Product is a good all in one printer.The areas of improvement are1) You need to manually connect Wi-Fi every time you start it.. it should rather remember prefered Wi-Fi networks2)it should remember passwords of prefered Wi-Fi networks2)

"I had ordered hp printer with free one set (black & tricolor) cartridge, but received only black cartridge.On complaining they had collected printer and again resend new hp printer after 4 days with same problem that is with only black cartridge and without free tricolour cartridge.I had lost the hope of getting free tricolour cartridge as shown while booking.I can't return the printer now as I had already wasted 12 days.
"
"Overall a good multi function printer except for the ADF. Printing and scanning work very well. Scanning via the sheet feeder has problems. About a third of the time some pages come only partially scanned. I have other HP printers that don't have this problem. Very annoying as the ADF is a key reason I got this printer.
"
"The printer is super slow. It has good features of wifi, but using wifi a print might take forever. The print speed is slow, and maybe my expectation is high, but for 2018 you can't wait for print this much. Looks fine. The printer is easy to install and is not bulky. My only problem with the product is the speed of the print.
"
"Useless product wrong info provided.its a useless printer with high running cost..the cartridge has been exhausted in just 30 prints...can you own up and change the printer else will not buy anything from Amazon site...you have given misleading information about the product...
"
"One of the main reasons for buying the product was the wireless printing feature... Wireless printing is extremely slow and sometimes takes 15-20 minutes to print. Sometimes only half of the pages just get printed. Print quality is pretty good. It has some good features too. Buy this if only if HP fixes the slow printing issue.
"
"Print quality and setting up is relatively easy. But paper print speed is slow. Sometimes when printing from phone stops half way !!!!!Overall I think it's OK for home use.
"
"If you really looking for budget model printer. Just go it..Price:-1. Affordable price2. Easy setup. Black and white printer available3. Wifi printer4. Good for small offices and shops.5. Easy to print by sending email.Cons:-1. Not ideal for business as the ink cost is bit higher for one print.
"
"Product is fine as expected from HP. Print quality is perfect. Just dont go with the offer of additional free 1 set of cartridges because they are giving just one additional black cartridge free. This offer is from HP, not from amazon. So go for the product without expecting color cartridge free worth approx Rs. 700/-. Amazon should correct it or should provide color cartridge also as described. Thanks and Good Luck.
"
"Print quality is above average. And easy to install. It has quite mode which I liked. Scan quality also good. School students can use this printer for their project work.
"

"
"My favorite feature is the available in built samples like,a reminder with one or two columns,soduku,weekly or monthly calendars,Music Notation Sheet,so so much more...
"
"The only concern that I have is The printer's model is deskjet 3835. But the Bluetooth and WiFi device shows it is deskjet 3830 series.
"

But overall functional is good.
