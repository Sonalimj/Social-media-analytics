Windows 10 & MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I've reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.\\n\",\n",

       " \"I ordered this laptop on May 11 (Saturday) and the product reached to me early morning on May 13 (Monday), so kudos to Amazon's delivery! I was worried about any damages or scratches, but the laptop was well packed.Coming to the laptop, I'm writing this review after using it extensively for 2 weeks. My review is divided into the pros and cons to cover all the features of this laptop:Pros:1) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.2) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.3) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.4) The touch is brilliant and extremely responsive. The inking pen has a quick response as well. If you're a designer, the inking pen can act as an added benefit, however, for me, it does not have any other utility than to play around with Paint 3D.5) Multifunctioning is smooth and the laptop doesn't lag or slow down when switching from one application to another.6) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.7) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.8) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.9) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.10) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn't feel any change in my typing speed.Cons:1) The screen- The screen is only HD and not FHD, so if you like watching 1080p videos, you won't get that full HD experience.2) There is no IPS or In-Plane Switching feature. The screen quality shifts with the slightest change, so you need to keep the screen in one angle to enjoy your video content. Even the slightest shift to the angel can lead to a change in contrast and black levels. So, not a comfortable experience overall.3) The volume is fine. It's not loud enough to play audios and videos for a large room full of people. You'll need a good speaker for your entertainment.4) The laptop heats up a lot when plugged into charging to a really uncomfortable level. You can't use the laptop on your lap while it's charging, especially in summers. I had to put the laptop in front of an Air Conditioner to cool it down a little.5) Though the laptop is sturdy, I'd suggest you avoid using the 2-1 feature multiple times at once. (just saying)Overall, there are more pros than cons of this laptop. The biggest minus point for me is the screen. I focused on the 256 GB SSD and didn't pay heed to the screen resolution and IPS. But, It's a good buy and I'm using it for both entertainment and work without any major concerns.This is a really good laptop if you wish to buy a 2-in-1 laptop and have a budget of 40-45k, but you can buy an FHD display with the 14-dh0101TU model that has the same specs as this one. I don't understand why the 101TU model wasn't launched with this and launched only a few days after it!\\n\",\n",
       " 'I bought it for my sister, she is a freelancer and I must appreciate the look first. I have used it for few hours and find so much comfortable in using, writing and overall accessibility of it. The built, texture and look of the laptop is quite premium. The touch screen is quick. It turns into a tablet very much quick and keyboards get disabled, so you don;t have to worry about keyboards getting pressed mistakenly while using it as a tablet.It is FHD, the visuals are good. The speed so far I have pretty much enjoyed.I recommend this laptop for students, freelancers, artists, writers and also good for traveling.It could be bit more lightweight but then, the cost must be high, so I give it that.the pen works cool. I am going to try more of it over the months, then see how it goes further.Overall, It is a must buy considering the price, brand, specifications, value for money and overall what you are getting here. If you want more specifications, you can go for i5 version or 8GB RAM version, but this model overall is cool\\n',\n",
       " 'This is a preliminary review as I have just received the laptop and played on it for a day. It looks beautiful and slim. 2 in 1 looks very good, as a tablet with inking technology, it is amazing. Pen is good, it will be better to add a screen guard as we need to force the touch of the pen to the screen. This is my first i3 as I have always used i5 or i7, speed seems to be fine but have to see after loading bunch of software. SSD hard disk will be definitely a boost, planning to throw another 4gb ram stick to make it 8gb to compensate i3 performance. So far so good, will update later.First edit:It does not have backlit keyboard and modifying hardware like adding RAM or adding bigger SSD is very difficult in this model, just found all X360 hp laptops are compact and tightly packed like mobile phones. Battery is placed inside and could not be replaced easily like other or older hp laptops. This is definitely an inconvenience for people who are computer savvy and keep updating their laptops.\\n',\n",
       " \"I think, It's a great deal and works like a charm. I was skeptical before buying this but overall it is a good buy if your budget is between 40k-50k as it comes with corei3 8th Gen,MS Office, Windows 10,360 degree, Tablet and touch screen with pen.. so what else we need..I did not feel any slowness as well so far.. However this review is based on 3 days of use.. so wait and see if someone is writing after a month.. but we can buy it👍\\n\",\n",
       " \"first thing first -performance of this machine is same as an i3 with ssd has to be -no complaints there. Its a Very good looking laptop. you will surely love it.But Biggest letdown is display. Let me tell you that if you are considering a laptop then look for full HD display.this one has HD display which provides so so images. The let down by display is visible all over.more to that the Glass on display is pathetic-as it reflects everything . It makes viewing so difficult that it keeps you annoyed all the time.i will update more as i get  more of it.UPDATE:- i am using it now for a considerable time.My biggest complaint was display and let me admit honestly that i am now used to it. i do not find it that annoying. But yes, i would still suggest to go for FHD laptop with few bucks more.Actually HP should have given FHD at this price point.(i bought this at 43K).Touch screen is gd. i am not using the Stylus at all,i think this will be case with every other customers. (samsung Galaxy Note owners know it well).the stylus -its there , because its just there,actual use is minimal.). So while purchasing don't get distracted with HP pen. its not an advantage unless you really require it.\\n\",\n",

       " 'I got the laptop for 42990 which is a fair deal and as usual Amazon is awesome. First let me give you the cons.Cons:1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) the viewing angles could have been better.Now the pros:1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is inlclude.Overall worth it.\\n',\n",

Hence changed the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.The unit is very lightweight. I was looking for a reasonably priced 2 in 1. Overall a very good value for money. The 4 GB of RAM seems a bit insufficient. Else, it serves my purpose of using the system mainly for documentation, spreadsheets and presentations. Yet to try out the pen..EARLIER INITIAL REVIEW.... Changed as above!!!By reading product details we get the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. The product details etc. are to be changed to clearly indicate this.Note: We just got the delivery last evening.

       " \"I bought this laptop (HP 14q cs0018-tu) for 19k INR in July 2019 on Prime day. It's really fast because it has an NVMe SSD with read speeds exceeding 1 GB/s! Windows 10 boots in less than 5 seconds. This is probably the cheapest laptop with a fast NVMe SSD (Toshiba KBG30ZMV256G). The Kaby Lake-R Pentium Gold processor 4417U has 2 cores and 4 threads and is more or less equivalent to a Core i3. The laptop is thin and light, and the keyboard is decent. The charging brick is also small and portable with sufficient cable length.The major downside is the screen which is a sub-Full HD (1366x768) panel, but that's quite OK considering the price point. The other downside I noticed is that the two speakers are not symmetrically placed, but that's just nit picking.Overall, I'm really happy with this laptop. It's great for web browsing, productivity/office work, and light programming.  Easily the best laptop in the 20k INR segment and will handily beat more expensive laptops that have a 5400 rpm HDD.\\n\",\n",

There are many upgrade options available for this laptop So that you can improve the performance of this laptop. I didn’t find any other laptop where I can upgrade to Nvme m.2 SSD.So I was testing my laptop for the last few weeks without the upgrade and it was performing well. But there was some issues with the gaming, Photoshop and continues browsing with many tabs opened.Then I upgraded to WD green m.2 240Gb SSD (sata speed) and migrate the Windows OS to the SSD with the WD OS Clone tool which is available on the WD website. It did shows a significant improvement in the performance. The browsing, photoshop cc speed increased but not the gaming fps. Bought it form Md computers (online) for Rs 3500.If you have the budget go for Samsung 970 evo( Samsung 860 evo for low price).The boot time was reduced to 10sec, for HDD it was around 26sec , for SSD it was 16 sec.I tried to play GTA 5 on SSD , the loading time was reduced but it’s not playable even at lowest graphics settings.Then I upgraded the ram since 3Gb of my ram was always used by the OS, So I installed ADATA 4GB DDR4 2400Mhz ram for Rs 3000 , it really improved overall performance of the laptop. Ram is now running on Dual channel.The laptop came with Samsung M471A5244CB0-CTD Ram which was capable of running at 2666Mhz ,but the laptop motherboard only support 2400Mhz Ram. I opt the help of HP forum and a computer expert to find the best compatible ram for the laptop because there is a chance of some compatibility issues.I would say if you are buying any other ram other than ADATA  AD4S2400J4G17-R , Make sure that you take the laptop to a technician so that even if the ram doesn’t support you still won’t loose your money.I tried to buy online, but if it doesn’t support means I can’t return the product.Now I can play GTA 5 with average 30fps at low settings,No photoshop editing lag ,applying filters and other effects.Pros:AMD RYZEN 3 performance is very goodCan be upgraded to nvme m.2 SSD (Samsung 970 evo the best)No overheating issues.Good viewing angle.Activated windows 10 HomeFast chargingCons:Battery life max 4hrsTouchpad not preciseNo backlit keyboardSpeakers averageRam and SSD slot not easily accessible\\n',\n",

I am a writer. So, my basic needs (applications) on a laptop/computer are - Ms Word, Ms Excel, Paint, Google Chrome, Firefox Browser. I barely watch movies/YouTube on it. I don't play games on it.

Got it for 22k. 3k extra for 4gb ram Module as 4 gb is not sufficient for Windows 10. Many who complained about laptop being slow should upgrade to 8 gb. It has changed the response drastically. No more hang ups. Adding a ssd could do wonders though have not added one yet.Edit. Finally decided to add a ssd drive. bought WD Green 120 GB M2 drive for Rs. 2280 from amazon. Added it myself. Now the speed difference is apparent in test results. system boots in 15 secs as compared to 40 secs earlier. responses have become much better. the reading speeds are good but writing not so great. I would suggest if you can spend more go for WD blue or Samsung Evo 860. they are more expansive but have writing speeds in the range of 500MB/S. WD Green is for budget users and I feel satisfied with the performance for the price paid.Edit 2 - Many were complaining about battery backup not as expected. Initially when i was using wifi and at moderate brightness i was getting 4-5 hours max. but once you turn off wifi and use it for moderate works like watching movies(not ultra 4k resolution but upto 1080p or 720p) the backup is around 6-7 hours. and while working on word excel etc backup is up to 10 hours usually.

       " \"After Using More Than a Month here is my Review.  This Hp Model only supports Windows 10. You can't install windows 7 you will get an error of Acpi is not Fully support, contact BIOS vendor. (my Bios are upto date as per vendor).For Linux Environment  Wifi will not Supported. You need buy a seperate wifi adaptor dont buy this if you are intend to use for Ubuntu or Kali Linux or any linux environment, Graphics  managable just ok.you will only get 250+MB video Ram which is worst part , you can't work o  adobe programs properly. Battery  backup is 3hrs only. Watched a full movie (2hr15minutes) at 100%  and after finishing 20% remained. Camera quality is GOOD. Display Reflects a lot not friendly. Has some Graphics driver problem which supplier doesn't accept when i gave feedback. You will get bsod error when some applications use graphics (thats not application problem at all ) purely manufacturer defect which they don't accept. Now for the Windows 10 google to disable so much of bloatware which will increase battery and performance. Use the dark mode available in personalization.  My rating 2/5 for medium type users. 4/5 for normal users.\\n\",\n",
       " 'If you like to analyse for hours/days/weeks even, before buying a product, especially the technical stuff, then this review\\'s helpful for you.To be honest, I was super scared to buy this. I know HP has a good reputation, but there was hardly any review regarding this product and not any detailed one. Plus I bought it during Diwali sale so the time was running. And the purchase was to be made in prepaid manner since Amazon doesn\\'t allow COD on products costing this much, and there is no return but only replacement allowed on this laptop, so YIKES! Thankfully I did my homework for whole 2 days, learnt the basics of buying a laptop (type of ram I would prefer. what processor, battery strength, etc.) and searched around a lot and decided that this was the one I could get for greatest value at lowest price (Anyone else who is technologically disabled as I am, please refer to Amazon\\'s laptop buying guide - that helped me a lot to understand what I want on my own and compare various models to narrow down on the one according to my priorities).Quality of laptop:Looks 9/10: I love the silver and textured look that this lappy gives off. The one star I deducted was because I have been told that the keyboard has been an issue for few customers because the letters are printed in dark gray. so there is not much of contrast. This wasn\\'t an issue with me, coz I am already a fast typist and can type without continuously searching on keyboard. Please look at the images of the keyboard I have attached with this review and judge for yourself.Is it a fast laptop?: 9/10 Damn yes! Obviously during the initial setup it took quite a few minutes. After doing that, this lappy is super fast. I am a research scholar. I don\\'t indulge in gaming right now. But I almost always have like 20-30 tabs open simultaneously for weeks or months together. So far, this lappy with its 8 gb ram seems to function efficiently even though I\\'ve got 10 tabs open right now. I deducted 1 star because I want to see if this will behave the same way after heavy usage. I will update this again after a few months of usage and change the rating accordingly.How\\'s the battery?: 8/10 It came with a 39% charged one. I charged it to 100% and plugged it out. I have been watching videos online and downloading and browsing study stuff for the past 1 hour and it only reduced to 85% and that is doable for me. Happy with this one, coz no particular specification is mentioned related to battery usage in the specifications except for 3-cell battery mention (I asked my tech friend about this and he had said it should work upto 6 hours with regular browsing). I deducted 2 stars because of my own jealousy, coz another laptop by HP is available in the touchscreen series at same price with claim of 7 hours battery life in average and upto 13 at max. I gave that up for this, because my friend has had a touchscreen one, and the reflective surface is simply horrifying - too reflective, super sensitive, not at all visible from side angles/if you are standing at a peripheral position. Anyway, I hope this one does me prouder. 2 stars deducted also because laptops with 7-8 hours battery life are available at the same price. I will update it again after I check when the battery drains completely after heavy usage.The screen: 9.5/10! The only reason I was hesitant about was because I did not want a reflective surface screen - those are absolute headaches, my eyes hurt plus I get super scared looking at my own reflection after watching a horror movie (ha!). Anyway, this product surprised me with exactly what I wanted - a MATTE screen!! Not a screen skin/guard but the screen itself! In the specifications it was mentioned that a standard LED backlit screen\\'s available, so I thought I was settling. But this was such a pleasant surprise. The matte screen does not reflect, the glare\\'s low even if I increase the brightness plus really contributes to the laptop\\'s aesthetics. Then why didn\\'t I rate this 10/10? Because I am greedy and I really like if when the LCD covers the whole of screen. I am not really fond of the black body around a screen. Basically I like the TV look on a laptop (if that makes sense), a higher screen to body ratio. But at this price? Steal this!Sound: 8/10 The sound is sooooooo much better than I expected. Clear and loud too. I deducted 2 stars, coz well, like I said I am a greedy girl and the louder it is, the better!Ease of navigating Windows 10: 10/10 My tech friend had advised me not to go for Windows 10 coz it lags/hangs. I am super glad that I chose not to listen to him. I have been using Windows 7 professional up to now. So I was a little nervous to switch. But the transition is super smooth. Everything is easier to find and access.MS Office 2019 version: 9/10 I am a PhD scholar. So you can imagine the value of this for me. I wasn\\'t willing to compromise on this version. But when I tried to activate, it was showing that only Office 365 version can be activated on this, nothing about the 2019 version. So I had a mini heart attack. After 5 mins of trying to use Office 365 version though, automatically a notification came up that prompted me to update the current version to Office Home and Student 2019 version (Phew!).I love the Microsoft Search feature they are showing off right now though. I deducted 1 star because I have received this lappy a week ago. I wanna use this for a longer period of time and update in case any issue comes up with this.Why buy this online instead of offline? At the same price, I was getting an offer to buy HP laptop with same specifications except for 4 gb ram and free goodies like headphones, bags, usb lights, pendrives, etc. But those over a 8 gb ram at the same price? Are you kidding me? This is a no brainer. You can buy the goodies yourself for under 1200 INR. But having a new ram of 4 gb difference plus the installation charges that would be charged to change/modify the old processor would amount at least up to 4k. Now it\\'s a matter of priorities. Goodies vs better processor aka speed.I HAD ONE ISSUE WITH MY LAPTOP MODEL THOUGH:On the keyboard. above 2 number button \"@\" icon was made, but whenever I tried to press it, inverted comma/\" appeared and \"@\" appeared when I pressed \" button. I thought this was a malfunction in the hardware? Maybe the icons got misplaced? I know it is a small matter. But oh well, my mind\\'s been wired to the traditional keyboard style and I wasn\\'t looking to experiment with it. After an hour though, it became okay (o.O ??) Like it was supposed to in the first place. This is strange and sounds weird. Anyway, why I mentioned this here is if this happens to you, give it an hour or so and keep using your laptop normally. If it still doesn\\'t get resolved like mine did (by magic?), then do contact the customer support of Amazon or ask for a replacement if it irks you enough.Thanks for reading my lengthy review!\\n',\n",

UPS of this device is 7th gen processor, decent Storage and HP brand reliability. But apart from that there's hardly anything to attract. It lacks fingerprint sensor, Backlit keyboard, decent battery backup, better graphics and better display resolution. If there's a deal and if its available around 25k then go for it, else invest few thousand more and go for better device. For 30k its Not worth buying.\\n\",\n",

As stated by others, performance is a slight issue. It is not fast or snappy and can take few seconds to launch apps. To get around it, i have added 4 GB Crucial 2400 RAM in Dual Channel and increased it to 8 GB. Though it is a challenge to remove the Back Cover to insert the RAM.

Came across this beauty as it was a notebook with great and power-packed specs. HP at it's back, it got a thumbs up from me.So using it for three days I have my impressions as below.Build Quality :- Absolutely excellent. Though it is made up of plastic, great finish and not prone to fingerprints.Display :- A FULL HD 1920×1080 panel makes it worth to consume media and other stuff. I loved the display but viewing angle are okaish.Battery :- This is where the device shines. With normal usage it is giving a usage time of 6-7 hrs or more but while gaming it's reduced to half due to the heavy NVIDIA GTX 1050 operations.Keyboard :- Much tactile and solid buttons with brilliant backlit coloured in green. Mouse Pad is average due to non-seperated buttons.Finally, it's a great and ideal deal for a student or other works. Recommended to buy.\\n\",\n",
       " \"Belive me this laptop is a true beast with gtx1050, it gives resonable fps on most AAA games. This laptop gives the best B&O sound experience, sometimes it is even loud as jbl go, but all you need is perfect drivers for that and let the sound fly. The best thing is battery life, it once gave me 5 hrs with autoCAD, and 6 hrs of movie(vlc) time, but thats not it comes with some kind of boost chargin, which takes approx 50 mins to get fully charged from zero.Aesthetics are pretty neat. Acid Green color stands bold and beatiful not like those cheap red. Laptop body is another plus point, its clean and bold with a small touch hp logo it makes it elite.About basic features:It really has a nice keyboard one of its class I really it. Touch pad is the one that dissapoints me, its not that bad buut in this price range and features they should have worked a little bit for that.The port select is just normal. You get 3 usb 3.0 with hdmi, ethernet port, hdmi, headphine jack.

Anti-glare screen is good.Cons: The only drawback I have noticed is, Delay in Bootup time. It takes almost 45sec+ to load the home page (i am not sure about the Windows OS).

I have been a user of the Macbook Air for the last 3 years and was hesitant to buy a windows laptop having gotten used to the Mac at home. But the price differential of almost 23K between this and the Macbook Air + MS Office as well as the fact that on Apple Mac I cannot save XML files easily, additional purchase of MS office, no flash player, etc. forced me to purchase this laptop yesterday. I am very impressed with it so far. Set up was easy and smooth. The Laptop has a matt finish that feels great to look and feel. It feels as light as my Macbook Air. The display is superb. The keyboard is soft to use and accurate. Boot time is a few seconds and a little slower than the Mac where it is instantaneous but that is hardly a negative here. Some people have asked if MS office comes pre-installed and the answer is YES. I just had to accept the license agreement and that was it. It also comes with a trial period of MacAfee antivirus for a month. Satisfied in every way with this purchase. Hope it is as reliable and virus free in the months and years to come as my Macbook Air. I think the 8GB Ram and the 256GB SSD combination helps in the weight and boot time for this laptop.\\n',\n",
       " \"Amazing combination THAT'S VERY, very rare to find in any brand.Pros:1.) 8th gen i5 is futureproof (there was a more than usual jump in performance bw 7th and 8th gen, so DON'T go for any of the 7th gen processors!!!)2.) SSD is blazing fast, 3-5 seconds is the boot time. 256 GB is sufficient these days, given most of our stuff stays in cloud.3.) 1080p screen is crisp and sufficiently bright4.) Build quality of laptop is above avg, but looks are very good.5.) Light weight, 14 inch form factor allows massive protability.6.) Surprisingly good battery life! The battery life is way above avg but it's actually the super low charging time which impressed me.Cons:1.) No dedicated graphics2.) Build quality and feel could have been better. The finish looks good, but attracts smudges a lot.But these cons won't really matter to folks like me who just code and don't play games.If you wanna need a powerhouse in a 14 inch 1080p screen with SSD, this one will ace the job!!!\\n\",\n",

Crisp keys. Great typing experience.2. It came with pre-installed office 2019 and windows 10 home.3. Pretty good battery. The battery optimization scroll function which lets you balance battery life and performance is very helpful.4. Great touchpad with multiple gesture functions, some of which are like Macbook\\'s. You can switch between apps using 3 finger swipes. You can go back to desktop from anywhere with downwards 3 finger swipe. You can go to tabs view with upwards 3 finger swipe. You can open notification panel with 4 finger tap. You can even enable horizontal and vertical scroll for the touchpad. It will work on the touchpad borders once you turn it on. The touchpad settings software is a must to customize and makes working much faster.5. Dark mode is great and works universally.6. Light weight and can easily be carried around using a single hand.7. Additional slot for SSD expansion. You can make it hybrid storage.8. Great color and screen contrast.9. Almost every element of the system is highly customizable and that\\'s great.Cons :1. It is already thin, but with its weight and size, it could be thinner.2. You cannot change your username under C:/users if you while logging in for the first time logged in with Microsoft account. If you do that, Microsoft will take the first 5 letters of your email and make it your permanent username. You won\\'t be able to change that.I\\'d suggest initially logging in without logging into anything and just skip the option. That way you can change your own username. I had reset the whole computer because it was annoying. I don\\'t know why Microsoft can\\'t fix something so small.3. No anti-glare screen. If a light reflection is there you just gotta increase the brightness 🤷🏼\\u200d♂️4. The bezels could\\'ve been thinner.5. Doesn\\'t comes with a bag.It\\'s not the laptop that sucks in any way. It\\'s Microsoft windows, the most mainstream OS of the world that sucks. Windows 10 certainly has a much larger scope of customization compared to previous windows.This laptop is built more for professional usage but you can easily run mid tier games. However if you\\'re looking more towards gaming and less towards MS office, you can get a laptop in SAME PRICE RANGE with nvidia graphics but then you probably won\\'t get office.Overall, the pros overweigh the cons. This is probably the best 14\" laptop between 40-50k. If your budget is near 50k, put 2 thousand more and buy that HP 14 with the same features + 256 GB SSD and silver colour. BUT if your budget is less than that, You probably won\\'t find a better option with office 2019 lifetime validity.Must buy if you\\'re involved in typing a lot of professional stuff since it has pretty well laid out keyboard with preloaded office.Do like if you found this useful.Feel free to ask any questions!!\\n',\n",

PUBG will stutter at highest settings so I recommend 720p with medium settings for a lag free performance.I would recommend a cooling pad while using the laptop for gaming as it gets pretty hot and thermal throttling could be an issue here if you are not using it on adequate surfaces (for example if you like playing on your bed). I use an external monitor and gaming set while at home so it’s easy to just dock it to a cooling pad. If you are playing directly on the laptop using the laptop keyboard, Play around with pad adjustments until you find a position that is ergonomically suitable for you.Battery life is average at best during gaming. I could play just about 2 full rounds of CODBO4 in the highest settings at 1080p and 3.5 rounds of PUBG in Medium settings at 720p before the low battery mode kicked in at 20%. Though to be honest I never use my laptops on battery while heavy usage and always carry my adapter around wherever I go.On the other hand, battery backup was pretty decent while streaming videos or other day to day tasks. You can easily watch 2 full movies at 80% brightness and still have some juice left before it reaches 20%.All in all, this is a good machine at a really good price, especially for Intermediate gamers like me. If you are a Pro gamer, then HP Omen series are what you should be looking at instead of this.\\n',\n",

This is an issue with all HP laptops.- Camera: nothing to write home about but doesn't matter.- RAM 4 GB is too little for this day and age. Buy this laptop if you can upgrade the RAM immediately.- Battery is awesome, it lasts 6 hours easily, i thought this kind of battery comes only in high end notebooks.- Sound is loud but terrible quality.- Touchpad is sensitive and keys are flat and large so typing is a treat.- Loads Windows in 6 seconds due to the SSD (also i have no heavy software installed yet).I paid Rs. 44,600 and at that price it is simply the best laptop out there. Now price have decreased to Rs. 43,369. If it is within your budget buy it soon and be luckier than me. It is also available at Rs  41,999 on Tata Cliq but i trust Amazon.Hope this review is helpful.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Let's break this review into 5 parts:1.Overall look2.Performance3.Software experience4.Battery life5.Other features1.Overall lookFirst of all lookwise the laptop looks very very premium.The build quality is certainly very good on this and the best part of the build quality is that it does not flex at all.The top seems to be made up of some magnesium or aluminium alloy, the keyboard layout and surrounding material.also seesm to be of aluminium .The bottom section is of high quality plastic based.The power button on the side glows when you are using the laptops and seems to be cool.Overall the laptop very finely built.2.PerformanceNow speaking of the performance I must say I am impressed here.Dont judge this laptop by its processor.even though it has core i3-8145U 8th generation processor but this processor has turbo boost a feature that had never been seen before in any i3 processor.It has a base frequency of 2.1Ghz and during turbo boost it can clocked upto 3.9Ghz and believe me guys it just blazing fast.Laptop seems very snappier.It has a Samsung 2433 MHz RAM and it is really fast.Now the most important thing about any laptop is the kind of storage used in it.Here we have SSD.let me clear this , the SSD used here isnot SATA based , it is a m.2 PCIe based NVME SSD Toshiba SSD and I think this is the main contributing factor for this laptop performance.Since it is using a SSD perfoance is very good plus booting time is hardly 7-8 seconds.The keyboard has a nice feeling to it while typing and it has backlit.The bang and Olufsen speaker are also very crisp and clear and descently loud.Since this laptop has SSD,I am.happy to say it has no heating issues.The screen is full HD IPS LCD display and it is very ubrant in Colors.The brightness is good and it is sharp Plus it is touchscreen.HP seems to include fast charging here as the laptop charges 64 percent in 50 minutes which is very good.Now speaking about battery life,battery life is descent with 6-10hours of battery life.After I started using this laptop, I received a BIOS update and after that the battery backup seems to be good . I got 7.00 hrs of battery backup with this laptop.In context of I/O port it has two usb 3.1 ports which is rare in this price segment , a type c port and an HDMI port,alongwith headphone jack(oh my god!).3.Software ExperienceThe laptop is powered by windows 10 May 2019 update (1903) and since it's windows 10 you will get software updates and future windows version along the road.It came with a full version of 2019 which needs to be activated I activated the same without having any issues.4.Battery lifeBattery included in 41 Watts and can lasts upto 6-10 hours of battery life.5.Other featuresThe trackpad included here is windows precision trackpad.The included HP pen is really very cool and has very very low latency.Also.the laptop is 360 degrees rotatable and hence can be used it tent mode,360 mode and tablet mode also.Final verdict the laptop is very good.Hp has certainly improved their quality of product.The only concern is the 256 GB of storage I suggest to purchase an external.hard drive if not you can upgrade the m.2 SSD also.Just don't believe on anything negative regrading the laptops.Only processor will not make a laptop gudIt's the whole package that integrates with the laptop make it a good one.If u want a lightweight and powerful laptop go with this one One important thing to note is if you purchased another variant of this laptop with 720p HD screen then it don't have a backlit keyboard and display is certainly less sharper than 1080p one.Delivery feedback:Last thing i want it share is the pathetic Amazon delivery service.The laptop shipped in time and also reached my city.But the delivery agent  don't what wrong with him made it out for delivery at 9pm and after repeatedly calling him haven't received the call and around 1.00 am in night started blank calling him.The next day it came to me that the laptop was not returned back to couriers but in the possession of the agent for whole day.I had to escalate the matter at the higher level and after continue following up the next whole day they deliver my laptop.A word of advice from me, if you are writing this laptop for this price in the local ho.store then please purchase from it as Amazon has no control over their delivery agents.And Amazon please do consider this feedback seriously as agents are not allowed to call after 9.00pm certainly not at 1.00AM in the morning I guess!\\n\",\n",

I mostly work on Excel so full size keyboard is useful for me.Battery backup is 6 hrs which is good.I would have loved to give it 5 stars but I am giving 1 star less because Amazon sent me an Invoice with wrong Serial number. For almost 1 month I was calling them regularly. Amazon refused to change their invoice due to some technical reasons & gave me seller's contact number. Finally I managed to get the correct Invoice from the seller. Seller was customer friendly & co-operative. He immediately sent me the correct invoice.But I am very disappointed with Amazon's customer service. The product is amazon fulfilled, still I had to call them again & again.

Also selected SSD (256GB) for fast boot up. As per past feedback, normal HDD gives more boot up time for Windows 10 while boot up is very for fast for SSD. It takes vary few seconds. However cost of laptop due to SSD is slight higher. Only small drawback is that SDD is 256 GB while HDD normally 1 TB capacity. However external hard disk can be connected with SDD if required.HP Laptop 15.6 inch full HD screen is very good. MS office licence version is preinstalled i.e. no trial version and no need to purchase extra. It is very good and its price of MS office and Windows 10 is already included.DVD drive is also provided.This laptop is very good for normal day to day jobs, coding for engineering college student.Quality of this HP Laptop is very good.

The webcam is also on a positive side. But what I fell the inbuilt keyboard will get damage soon. The quality of the inbuilt keyboard is extremely low.

There are multiple I5 models from different brands like Lenovo, Dell and even Asus but HP is the least costliest.

Apart from price, the delivery was also done quickly within a day, and the laptop is loaded with windows and Microsoft applications. To talk about performance, the laptop boots in just over 3 sec and is quite capable of running fairly complex programs. For instance, I have deployed python and SQL on the laptop and code gets executed without any lag.  The speed comes mainly from SSD which gives performance on par with i7. In terms of disadvantages, the laptop could have been better interms of display quality as youtube videos look bit dim at times but it's speed and build quality makes up for the minor flaws. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is looking for a laptop for doing a bit of complex coding to daily usage.\\n\",\n",

       " 'Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\\'t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed & higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (\"HP assistant\" is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\\'t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop & my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\\n',\n",

Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don't do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it's okay, you don't get everything at this price point.  It's about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a 'cool' look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)\\n\",\n",

I have Adobe's light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn't actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM.

       " \"I bought this laptop thinking its vfm with what's offered at the discounted price, but I was so wrong.Let's see what I got for the price I paid.1st laptop: It arrived, I booted it up and updated everything, but as it was new I did not bothered to check around but upon later I came to know it was a defrctive one. The fan inside was touching some part because of which it used to make weird sound and this caused it too rotate slow. Because of this the cpu was not able to get enough air and it caused the cpu to cut down power which slowed down the whole laptop. Also the seal was tampered one so I decided to file for a replacement.Amazon representatives were of no help even after 3 calls and conversation of several hours, finally 4 days later my replacement was confirmed. Until then the representative made sure that they tried every single trick on me to force me to keep the product and keep me stalling.Replacement arrived after 2 days of confirmation and the old one was picked up at the same time.Replaced Laptop: Screen bleeding or burn in not so sure of but it was present, screen upper whole part was yellow and the other than that the whole screen was white. Left side panel was not fitting properly and something was coming out of it, keyboard was hit and miss, it sometimes did not took input.As it was a replacement, asking amazon to take it back was not going to be possible as I had seen how they were acting when they had to send in a replacement. Went ahead and filed a complain with hp, they sent an engineer who checked out the laprop and to his surprise the laptop's hard disk lock was broke which caused improper fitting of panel and thing poppong out of panel. He was not able to diagnose what the issue was with the panel but it was surely visible and even he was confused. The keyboard issue was also detected and he asked me what would I like, a replacement or a repair.As my return window with amazon was available and also hp has 11 days replacement option, I went ahead for replacement, to which I was provided a doa letter which I had to send to amazon and procure a replacement.I went ahead called up amazon, to my surprise the guy was hellbent to send an amazon technical representative at my place to diagnose the laptop, even though hp's own engineer had already carried it out, well location was not in their covered facility due to which they finally asked me what I want and I went for return as replacement for the third time was just illogical.My money was refunded, and to those who are willing to buy it, let me shed some light on another issue:Laptop Price that I had paid Rs50990HP's MRP Rs59990 upon hp's discount at store or online store you will end up paying from 55k to 56k.But as I bought the laptop from another online retailer other than their own website or local resellers, it was not eligible for hp's offers that can get you 1st year adp with 2 year extended warranty for Rs999. I was forced to shell out Rs6999 which will get me only 2 years extended warranty nothing else.So the lesson i learnt was buy products from exclusive partners where you can get offers, or else you will end up shelling out more money for the same thing.I am attaching video where you can see how the fan caused the cpu to drop down speed from 100mbps to 4mbps and photos wjere you can see faulty replacement for your reference.\\n\",\n",

Don't panic, kindly contact HP India support center with your amazon purchase bill with product serial number and they are normally kind enough to reset your product brand warranty. Mine is still under process.Product Review: Let me set the expectation straight, it is a budget laptop.Build quality is plastic, but do not flexes much. Screen is not IPS, but HD quality and anti reflective. Key board is well layed out, but I find the back lit LEDs are bit too bright to my choice. Camera is okeyish, mic and sound is adequate; good for your regular skype calls.1 TB SATA and a old school DVD writer means, laptop is heavy. I would any day prefer to trade off DVD writer for some reduction in weight. Mind you, you will need a table to work on it for long.MS office 2019 H&S comes as lifetime free, but please follow process mentioned in Amazon video to get it activated. Actually, you will have to log in into your MS account from the installed word, activate Office2019 and then download and install it, as the installed version is Office365 trial.As expected with sATA, booting will take some time. I am not a gamer, so can't comment on that. Battery back up is very good for the price, expect 4-5 hours with regular work.Too early to comment on performance, but again it is Ryzen and not i5 and cost some 5k less.Overall, I would term it as a perfect home laptop for every one' use.\\n\",\n",

       " \"I bought this laptop thinking its vfm with what's offered at the discounted price, but I was so wrong.Let's see what I got for the price I paid.1st laptop: It arrived, I booted it up and updated everything, but as it was new I did not bothered to check around but upon later I came to know it was a defrctive one. The fan inside was touching some part because of which it used to make weird sound and this caused it too rotate slow. Because of this the cpu was not able to get enough air and it caused the cpu to cut down power which slowed down the whole laptop. Also the seal was tampered one so I decided to file for a replacement.Amazon representatives were of no help even after 3 calls and conversation of several hours, finally 4 days later my replacement was confirmed. Until then the representative made sure that they tried every single trick on me to force me to keep the product and keep me stalling.Replacement arrived after 2 days of confirmation and the old one was picked up at the same time.Replaced Laptop: Screen bleeding or burn in not so sure of but it was present, screen upper whole part was yellow and the other than that the whole screen was white. Left side panel was not fitting properly and something was coming out of it, keyboard was hit and miss, it sometimes did not took input.As it was a replacement, asking amazon to take it back was not going to be possible as I had seen how they were acting when they had to send in a replacement. Went ahead and filed a complain with hp, they sent an engineer who checked out the laprop and to his surprise the laptop's hard disk lock was broke which caused improper fitting of panel and thing poppong out of panel. He was not able to diagnose what the issue was with the panel but it was surely visible and even he was confused. The keyboard issue was also detected and he asked me what would I like, a replacement or a repair.As my return window with amazon was available and also hp has 11 days replacement option, I went ahead for replacement, to which I was provided a doa letter which I had to send to amazon and procure a replacement.I went ahead called up amazon, to my surprise the guy was hellbent to send an amazon technical representative at my place to diagnose the laptop, even though hp's own engineer had already carried it out, well location was not in their covered facility due to which they finally asked me what I want and I went for return as replacement for the third time was just illogical.My money was refunded, and to those who are willing to buy it, let me shed some light on another issue:Laptop Price that I had paid Rs50990HP's MRP Rs59990 upon hp's discount at store or online store you will end up paying from 55k to 56k.But as I bought the laptop from another online retailer other than their own website or local resellers, it was not eligible for hp's offers that can get you 1st year adp with 2 year extended warranty for Rs999. I was forced to shell out Rs6999 which will get me only 2 years extended warranty nothing else.So the lesson i learnt was buy products from exclusive partners where you can get offers, or else you will end up shelling out more money for the same thing.I am attaching video where you can see how the fan caused the cpu to drop down speed from 100mbps to 4mbps and photos wjere you can see faulty replacement for your reference.\\n\",\n",

Laptop longevity dictates that you have removable batteries for later replacement which won't be an option!Reasons why I chose the 250 G5:1. DDR4 2133 Ram: the latet and the fastest category2. The i3 6006u is one of the best budget to mid level chips out there in terms of battery/performance. Its a 14nm chip and hence also the heat levels are non existent.

A 50k+ laptop with 64 GB eMMC storage. Are you fooling Indian customers? For those who don't know eMMC is just like phone SD cards and they are not fast like typical SSDs (like Samsung or Intel SSDs). Only reason why this computer boots faster than say a Windows laptop of similar specs is because of Chrome OS. Although the screen on this is actually good IPS but I can't comment on actual quality though. Other specs are also good 8GB Ram and i5 CPU.Chrome OS : Chrome OS is a Linux distribution made by Google which is just a glorified Chrome browser with somewhat Android App support. The idea is that most people use there computers for browsing only so a chrome browser would be sufficient. It makes the OS fast and lot more secure than full fledge OS like Windows.The problem is that Chrome OS is very limiting for a student. I as a student use many more software other than Google Chrome on a daily basis. You may argue that Android apps are replacement for those applications but that's not the case.I can't compare Microsoft Office 2019 to the android version of Microsoft Office. Things get even worse for other specialized softwares like coding, engineering, image editing, video editing etc.Overall Verdict:Don't buy this laptop. It won't be useful for students, businessmen, or anyone for that matter. You can get i5 CPU, 8 GB RAM and 256 GB SSD (actual ssd not fake eMMC drive) for even less than this (look for Asus).It maybe only useful for some niche catagory who wants a laptop to check email and browse web or watch movies only but again 64 GB storage is very limited to store movies and you would have a better experience with Windows 10.\\n\",\n",

       " \"Review Unit: Intel Core i7-8565U (whiskey lake),16GB RAM, 512 GB SSD, 1W UHD (1080p) touchscreen with HP SureView, Dark Ash Silver with Copper accentsNote: Review submitted after 46 days of using laptop as daily driverThe HP Spectre ×360 is by far one of the most sleep Ultrabooks on the market. It's only competitor is perhaps the Dell XPS 13.In this review, I will be drawing many comparisons with the aforementioned Dell XPS of similar specifications.-----Design (5/5): The very first sight of my new Ultrabook was enough to make me fall in love with it. This is by far the most visually appealing laptop there has ever been (unless you're into big fat laptops from the early 2000s, in which case, this is definitely not for you). The color of the unit, the 'gem cut' design, the faceted corners, and pretty much everything about this laptop (including the luxurious, and thoughtful, packaging) screams premium.The Dell XPS has a rather elegant simplicity, but like most others, I would buy the HP Spectre just for its design. The side bezels are tiny, whereas the chin and upper bezels are relatively fat, which may give some a slightly aged impression. However, the extra bezel allows for a camera above the display (no nose cam like the 2017 XPS), one with Windows Hello IR facial recognition (which the its Dell counterpart doesn't have). Also, the same extra size on the keyboard deck allows for an extra speaker, which sounds beautiful (more on that later).Durability- The chassis is carved out of a single piece of aluminium, which makes for a very sturdy build. However, I did notice a good deal of flex on the screen, and on the keyboard deck. And after 45 days of usage, I realized that the right side of the keyboard deck was ever so slightly elevated, enough to wobble the screen when repeatedly pressed down.HP generally doesn't compare very well to Dell when it comes to build quality, but this laptop, being their most premium 13 incher, does fairly well in that domain.-----Port Selection (4/5): The ports on this device include 2 USB C Thunderbolt 3 ports, either of which can be used for charging (and one of which is placed on the right hand side chamfered corner), 1 USB A, a 3.5mm headphones jack, and a MicroSD card reader. As one can expect from a thin and light Ultrabook, there is no Optical reader on this device (nor is there an Ethernet cable port). This is great for legacy support, and at the same time, you can hook the laptop up to 2 4k monitors.-----Display (4/5): The display draws just 1W of power, which boosts its battery life by a good deal, as opposed to the general 2W displays. The shiny screen does accumulate a lot of fingerprints, as does the all metal body of the laptop, and can also be the source of some annoying glare. This problem is further compounded by a relatively low maximum brightness (again, owing to the low powered display), which may not be suitable for outdoor use (for dark, low contrast content like 'the Battle of Winterfell'.This unit also comes with the HP SureView feature, which on activation by a simple function key, washes out the screen, drastically reducing the viewing angles. I didn't find myself using this feature very often, but the small lot of people using this laptop for business purposes may benefit from it in public areas. Also, the washed out screen resembles the feeling you get when you have migraines (thankfully, on a much more tolerable level), but it's still very much usable.The colors on the screen are vibrant, and even the closest details can be observed rather easily without even having to upgrade to the 4K screen (which is the 2W non sure view version, and also costs a little more). The blacks are deep enough to mistake for an OLED screen, which came as a relief to me, as I'm obsessed with those.-----Sound (5/5): For buyers looking for a portable personal daily driver suitable for content consumption, if the display and design didn't do the trick, the sound will mesmerize you into buying it. Tuned by Bang & Olufsen, these speakers get it just right when it comes to higher notes. The lows are very good, but as one can expect from such a thin laptop, they don't produce the deepest bass. But again, none of the laptops in this segment do.The Spectre's design fits in 4 speakers, such that no matter what orientation the 2-in-1 device is positioned in, a speaker is always firing towards the user, which provides for an always crisp audio output. This was one reason as to why I was actually disappointed when HP refreshed the design with smaller bezels, which resulted in the omission of the speakers above the keyboard.-----Battery (5/5): As HP advertises, this battery is a monster. Of course, claims of 22-23 hours of battery are nowhere near the actual time I get on one charge, but I do get about 10+ hours on medium to heavy usage including an IDE, heavy web surfing, and intermittent videos being played. This is thanks to the low powered display I mentioned earlier.-----Performance (4.5/5): This is probably the only category in which the Dell XPS may surpass the Spectre, which is not to say that the HP Spectre isn't powerful enough, though. The Spectre's fast quad core processor blew right past anything I threw at it. However, the fans did kick in pretty soon. Although they don't produce too much of a noise, and are slightly customizable in the HP Command Center, I guess that's one of the not so perks of having an all metal design. The top of the keyboard deck did get a little hot, being metallic, but it was nothing beyond the expected levels.As far as graphic processing is concerned, the Spectre ships with Intel's integrated UHD 620 graphics, which is adequate for content consumption, and maybe even some light video editing and gaming. But don't expect the Spectre to be put to studio use without getting very hot, very quickly.Toshiba's NVME SSD (the fastest kind) proved to be blazing quick, producing amazingly high read and write speeds. Intel's Gigabit WiFi (WiFi 6) card also proved to be very, very quick, which I could see when YouTube automatically chose HD video quality at points in the house where I'd never before even been able to connect to the router, with older devices.-----Tablet Mode (4/5): As the name of the computer suggests, the hinge can rotate all of 360 degrees, enabling 4 different positions for you to use it in - Laptop mode, tablet mode, and the intermediary Tent and presentation modes. While the tablet and modes was really pleasant for content consumption, I found the presentation mode practically unusable, owing the the large amounts of screen wobble. This would probably be best suited for a long presentation or a large movie, where the laptop would just go untouched for a long time. The screen wobble was also too much to enjoy using the included HP Pen comfortably on laptop mode. I was also annoyed when Chrome didn't automatically open the on screen keyboard when I pressed the address bar (unless I used the pen). As with most other pens that come with convertible laptops, the HP Pen, although very smooth and useful (with 4096 levels of pressure sensitivity) felt rather heavy to use. I look forward to them getting lighter, before using this to take hand written notes, which I wouldn't do anyway, on a laptop.-----Keyboard (5/5): HP, as always, impressed me with their wonderful keyboard. I took little time to adjust to this beauty, which had great feedback with its ample 1.4mm of key travel, and we'll spaced Chiclet style keys, with 3 different levels of back lighting, which was also very uniform with no bleeding.-----Trackpad (4.5/5): The glass trackpad is very wide, and tall enough for my liking. Many complain about the lack of Precision drivers for the trackpad, but I don't understand the furore. There is obviously a difference between the existing Synaptics drivers and the Windows native Precision drivers, but the great hardware reduces the difference into almost unnoticeable. The trackpad was adequately responsive, and all of Windows' multi finger gestures were supported, with the occasional, but never frustrating, hitch.----- Other Security Features: The Spectre also comes with a fingerprint reader connected right at THE BIOS level, which provides for a very secure method to log in to the device. However, the same results in the fingerprint reader being rather slow, painfully so at times. However, the facial recognition was really fast, and made up for it.In addition to the SureView display, HP also included a physical Webcam kill switch right below the USB C port on the right side, which when enabled, physically cuts power to the camera, and removes it at the BIOS level. This should provide some solace to you privacy freaks out there.----------The Verdict: 4.5/5The HP Spectre has long been my favorite laptop, but as with anything else under the sky, isn't perfect. I'd recommend it to anyone who needs a fast laptop at home, or for general productivity tasks. The high speed SSD and the quick processor got me through everything without ever complaining about speed, other then when YouTube switched from full screen to normal, and vice versa, which took about a second, enough to not go unnoticed.While I would have really appreciated an OLED screen (which will be a part of the refreshed version as recently announced by HP), this got me through everything just as well.Value for Money: 4.5/5While I wouldn't say that the price tag (at the time of buying) isn't hefty, it sure is justified by the sheet quality and speed of the hardware and software components on the device. Add to that the convertible nature of the laptop, and you've got yourself a bang for your buck.\\n\",\n",

The screen had dead pixels but was still called certified refurbished. The only saving grace was the appearance which was not too bad. Hence please don't order high RAM and hard disk/ SSD config from these guys as they are spurious anyway. Please expect to spend more money on hard disk/ ssd, RAM, charger, battery. as all of these will be spurious .

       " 'Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\\'t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed & higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (\"HP assistant\" is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\\'t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop & my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\\n',\n",
       " \"I was looking for a laptop that is:1. Two in one Laptop plus tablet that is 360 degree foldable but not detachable  and comes with a free pen2. Full HD display, HDMI port, Type C  USB port  (this lat one is future proof for next few years)3. Backlit Keyboard (must have for me as I write in poorly lit places at times4. Comes with free Microsoft Office5. Not too small, not too big. I write lot of articles so figured out 14 inch screen just right for me6. Without graphic card  so as to cut the weight and price (I don't do video games or editing).7. A reputed brand8. Price less than 50KSo this HP Pavilion x360 14-cd0077TU  model matched all my requirements.  After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it's okay, you don't get everything at this price point.  It's about 10 days or more, I am  really happy so far.Go for it, if you have requirements similar to that of mine and in addition to  give a 'cool' look to others with 2 in 1 touch screen gadget at display :-)\\n\",\n",

After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe's light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn't actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it's deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.\\n\",\n",

After I checked the warranty online it was expired. I contacted HP customer care and the asked me for P-slip on which the serial no. of the product was written. I downloaded my P-slip and the serial no. written on it was different than that of my Laptop. I contacted Amazon for this and 1st they told me to wait for 24 hrs. After then nothing happened and now it has been almost 3 months and they still haven't solved my issue. Every time I contact Amazon they ask me to wait for 4-6 working days. And after that nothing happens and then when I contact them again they repeat the same thing. I fon't understand why amazon is so careless about my issue. Maybe they have given me the used product instead of real one thats why the serial no. is different and they are not changing it. I don't know what to do. They have already wasted my 3 months and also of warranty too. I also tweeted about my problem and tagged Amazon but they didn't respond.

       " 'Edit 3--------Using this laptop to play 4K content on a 4K TV drops the frame rate to less than 15 and it really struggles. Tested this on a latest 55 inch 4K Sony TV. I suspect its the basic GPU on this unit which cant do more than this. I personally dont own a 4K display yet, so still fine for my purposes for now.Edit 2 - More observations after the upgrade--------------------------------------------------------------------1) Photoshop and light room works just fine to edit 24 MP files from my SLR.2) Tried all sorts of video files (4K, DTS 7.1, X265 etc) with some of them having file size as much as 34GB. It worked on all flawlessly but slightly stuttered only on the biggest of 4K files which doesn\\'t play even half as good on any other computer I have. Even the bluray ISO files played flawlessly. The 8th gen processor is very good at this.3) Track pad sensitivity is excellent and is just as good as anything else I have used. I bought a HP laptop for my brother 2 years back and the track pad was very ordinary on it. Great improvement here.4) Movie play back clarity on this screen is top notch. But need to get it max brightness to be able to see clearly in dimly lit scenes. This may compromise battery life.5) Battery life is 4.5 hrs (it shows remaining time if you change it in BIOS). I wasnt expecting it to be any better either.6) Fan sound continues to draw attention. My daughter asked what the sound was as she hasnt heard any of my other laptops or PC make so much sound. With the room windows closed and AC on, my wife asked if it was raining outside (wasnt really expecting others to find it so obvious)7) Multi tasking is good. Opened multiple CPU crunching apps and they worked just fine. Tried opening a large Excel file with lots of formulas which sometimes makes lesser laptops struggle a bit. Worked just fine.8) Tablet mode is very good. I connected the laptop to my music system via bluetooth and makes it very convenient to listen to music and watch movies.9) Installed Asphalt 9 just to see how it handles. Works without any slow down but kicks up the fan to full speed and heats up as well. During installation, I tried browsing with firefox and it worked just fine. I dont use Chrome as it eventually becomes too heavy to handle.10) As you may all know, SSD makes the boot up and down really fast. This also helps in opening of apps quite fast.11) The RAM usage is now 60% on idle. With the added 4GB. it has more headroom than before and its noticeable.12) Headphone output is loud but not the best quality of sound ive heard. (Tested with audio technica ath m50x). Just decent sound. B&O play enhancements DO NOT work when connected to headphones via the 3.5mm audio output port. Search forums and you will see what I mean.If you are confused between 8th gen core i3 vs i5, consider the base clock speed. The i3 is 2.2 Gz and i5 is 1.8Gz. Higher the clock speed, faster the performance of tasks which only needs single core.Even though modern apps may have the capacity to use multiple cores, over 90% of them still utilizes only a single core to work. So i3 should suit your purposes just fine. If you are into gaming, you anyway need to consider i7 for its much faster clock speed & higher cores. I tried some basic testing in the shop on multiple laptops with i5 and i3. Not all i3 were better than i5 and not all i5 were better than i3. So I made an educated guess and bought this laptop with the upgrade predetermined. It worked out well in the end.Edit - This is my revised review on top and the original one at the bottom.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Performance of the laptop is now good. Here is what ive done to get there.....1)Upgraded the laptop with Samsung 256GB SSD and added Transcend 4 GB DDR4 RAM (both purchased in Amazon India)The install was done via HP authorized service center. I did the disk cloning before I went there. If they are to do that, the will charge lot more.2)Got rid of bloatwares (\"HP assistant\" is the biggest of them and also the Intel rapid storage). These are real system performance killers3) Installing Samsung Magician will handle the rapid performance, so don\\'t bother with any other settings for this.4) Got rid of the Mcafee AV (even though this laptop comes with a subscription) and installed Avast (my Favorite). This is just my preference.if any of you have installed Kodi (Home media SW), you know it takes few seconds or more when we exit that program. After the above steps, it closes down almost instantly.I honestly didnt think the performance could be improved so much with these upgrades and tweaking on this laptop.I will eventually try photoshop and other image editing programs as well.Now im OK with this Laptop. Also I anyway had decided to upgrade to SSD and 8 GB RAM when I finalized to buy this model laptop.The fan doesnt kick up as often as it did before for basic use but its still loud when system is under load. Hence the system heat up is also less frequent. However parallel tasks like working on the system while windows is installing updates in the background can be really slow.If you want much faster performance, buy a core i7 processor based laptop with SSD and 8 GB RAM. If this is too expensive, get the cheapest you can with i7 processor and upgrade to SSD and additional RAM.Initial impressions after few hours of use: (without any upgrades) - original reviewThe good:1) Price was cheaper than the shop by 3K. Good discounts on top of that which shaved the cost further by almost 4K.2)Touch screen is pretty good. Screen clarity is good as well. (Though I prefer Matt over Gloss.)3)The supplied touch pen maybe useful for some apps.4)Laptop is fairly compact and light.5)Sound from laptop speaker is better than most compact laptops but nothing to write home about.Not so good:1)Weak processor. The fan starts off with minimal work load and gets louder than my PC. Im yet to install any apps other what came with the laptop. I checked the CPU load on task manager and the CPU load spiked to 84% while opening the task manager itself. Ofcourse it dropped back to normal but my other laptop & my PC doesnt struggle so much on older gen processors.2)4GB RAM may not be enough either. The RAM usage on basic operations is over 60%3)Heat management is very ordinary. I barely used it and while lifting up the laptop the temperature was bit too hot to be kept in lap. If this is in August, I cant imagine how hot it will feel in May in a non air conditioned room in Chennai.4)The characters on the keys are very lightly printed. You cant see the keyboard too clearly without backlight or a fairly bright light in the room.\\n',\n",

After Amazon pay cashback it costed 46K, a value for money as it comes with free Office 2016.Initially it was very slow but as I watched few youtube videos to improve performance then it was pretty fast after I applied those tricks.The only low point is low battery life (gives 3 hours after my high performance settings). If you chose low performance settings, you may get 4 hours.  I think it's okay, you don't get everything at this price point.

       " \"I bought this product in a hurry during Diwali time and I regret almost daily. Below are a few but most critical issues I have faced ever since I bought this laptop1) Extremely slow and loading takes hell lot of time2) Though manual update is enabled system goes for auto windows update in every 2 days time. Updates runs for 6/7 hours which means you never get time to use the laptop3) No matter how many times you run shut down command the laptop continues to be on unless you physically shut it down4) can't even open 4 Window tabs simultaneously as it crashes5) Overall nice looking fancy gadget without any practical utilities..Extremely disappointing and hope I can get it replaced.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\xa0This laptop has an SSHD for boot up , so ideally it should be fast and smooth but sadly that is not at all the case , the apps crash and the laptop lags and becomes irresponsive as soon as you shift to tablet mode also it has a problem of over heating. All in all the performance is highly dissatisfactory. I have a Macbookpro that i bought in 2014 and even that works better than the new HP x360 that i got. Also , even after constant attempts Amazon has not yet helped me getting a refund or even a replacement for the product.\\n',\n",

I am already facing issues with the audio, the company claims it to be a software update issue. The heat sink stopped working and it's been more than 15 days since the complaint has been raised yet they have to replace the part not sure of they are yet to manufacturer it. Pathetic after sales service. The laptop is slower than a P1 system. I would never recommend this product to anyone. Will update this review once the part is replaced to see if it improves the performance.\\n\",\n",
       " \"This is an awesome laptop. It has premium look. And as some review mentioned it is a bit slow with 4 GB ram but once you upgrade it to 8GB it runs smoothly without any single lag. After RAM update even the boot time has changed noticeably. I have Adobe's light room, photoshop, illustrator and Skylum Luminar installed in this computer and everything works fine without any lag with 8 GB RAM update. The stylus along with it is not so useful for drawing in illustrator as it lacks accuracy but for regular uses and note taking this is enough. i3 8th gen has same processor speed as i5 (there are difference in cores). But most of the software doesn't actually utilises the cores efficiently. So this one is  a cheaper option. Buy this laptop and update the RAM. If you can afford update the HDD to SDD and use the current 1TB HDD as an external hard disk. I am doing it and once you give this cute laptop it's deserving hard-disk and RAM it will surprise you.\\n\",\n",

The screen had dead pixels but was still called certified refurbished. The only saving grace was the appearance which was not too bad. Hence please don't order high RAM and hard disk/ SSD config from these guys as they are spurious anyway.

The service engineer replaced the hard disk. However the USB media I bought from HP shelling out Rs. 1100 is not working. Finally the service engineer installed windows by cloud recovery.

       " \"After researching a ton, I settled on this laptop. Don't let the price fool you. It is solid. I added an extra 4gb of ram to the laptop and now it flies. For those interested...it has 2 RAM/DIMM SLOTS but only 1 is used (4gb) the other is free to add an extra dimm to. also make sure you use DDR3L (low voltage) as im not sure the regular DDR3 voltage would be motherboard compatible...the stock dimm was a Hynix DDR3L 4gb (hynix is hyundai's electronic division). Boot up on win 10 x64 bit is 7 seconds max. The extra ram really makes the computer zip through processes. I've had no heat issues, and no glitches so far after a month of use. I love the weight/solid finish with a pseudo brushed metal type of artwork around the touchpad areas. It doesn't feel like cheap plastic. The AMD A6 is one of the best processors and has a great long life if you take care of them well. I have an older A6 dual core that is still running well after almost 6 years. Of course you have to clean your laptops vents from dust and keep it in a cool place and your AMD A6 will serve you well!. Don't waste your money on an overpriced INTEL I3 i5 etc generation processor...its a complete waste of money. Plus intel has had lawsuits in the past over faulty soldering of processors (just google it).... The only things I didn't like were that the keyboard is fused into the laptops' moulding which makes cleaning the keyboard harder (thankfully i bought a keyboard protector but still this should be designed better as a removable keyboard), the screen is ok and it is great that it is anti-glare (matte finish) by default but dont expect an IPS HD screen at this price point. This is more for presentations/students/moderate office work stuff...I haven't tried gaming on it but I wouldn't expect a high FPS on this laptop.Finding drivers for this pc is a bit of a pain...but it can be done....first install the HP Support assistant and follow along as it checks your pc drivers and warranty etc...or you can look for a similar HP laptop with a similar chipset....and use the drivers from its support page....like the HP 15g 221au drivers some of them work for this pc .....Oh forgot to mention as an audiophile you will love this laptop's sound quality (speakers are located on the bottom where you're wrists usually rest....but the DTS sound application along with the REALTEK sound driver (they make the best sound cards imo as a long time user).....will blow you away...don't expect solid thumping bass as its unrealistic to do that...but the sound clarity and volume loudness is very good compared to other laptops....put in a good set of over the ear headphones and play with the DTS settings....(which turn off the default generic windows equalizer) and you will be amazed at the sound clarity and bass produced via the DTS application.the webcam is really good and great to do basic skype or photo snaps with....This computers bios if I remember correctly also allows VT (virtualization technology) so those interested in virtual machines or other simulation software would be able to do it with this...The DVD drive is a slim dvd writer....with a small profile and quiet when spinning/readingIt has a Rj 45(lan port), vga port, hdmi port 1x usb 3.0 port, and 2x usb 2.0 ports Touchpad is responsive but not made by synaptics (Elan touchpad) which is a bit of a downer as synaptics makes the best touchpads....but this gets the job done still.....no issues with trackspeed or movement...Bluetooth is very good uses the realtek chipset and connects on the first shot...no issues there...realtek wifi chip is very good as well...can get signal from 3 floors down (in a concrete house with rebar and several walls btw) you just need to make sure you get a good wifi driver for the card to work really well as the default windows driver only gives like 1 bar whereas the realtek driver gives you 4-5 bars of signal strength.....plus settings you can manipulate via device manager/control panel....I recommend getting this laptop if you are on budget and also buying a keyboard protector (saco brand makes it)....sure this laptop is about 2 years old in terms of chipset (probably mid 2015 to 2016 in terms of the AMD A6 7333 but at the price point along with what comes with it in terms of ports and chipsets its well worth it!

First create your own outlook I'd like how we are creating in Gmail, Yahoo....2. Then Left side bottom search box, just type  Excel and click the Excel.3. It will ask you to activate.. just click activate and enter your outlook username and password, what you have created or already having.4. Enjoy for life time..5. Meanwhile don't click office 365, bcz its not for life time...I hope you will enjoyReview after 15 daySystem is superb. It's very fast in terms of opening Ms office,GC,IE... No lagging...Those who complaining about hanging... Update the system even bios also...Once it's done you won't find the lag...Meanwhile don't expect the speed when you're booting first time...31/10/19 updateWhen I clicked ❓in the right bottom, opened HP page. Where I got the 4 updates. It seems, it's very important update for bios, Bluetooth, lan and wifi. Those who are complaining system is slow, this update may helpful...\\n\",\n",

       " 'This laptop is sleek and lightweight. The product startup post shut down is very slow.  Probably because of windows 10 and just 4 GB ram.  The unlocking of laptop post startup takes approximately 3 mins and is slow.  The laptop is just fine for browsing and not more.  You cannot take up work for heavy excel sheets or cannot play games as well. The web pages too take time to download and you will experience a lag of 30 seconds.  Sound quality is better as compared to other laptops at this price. Overall just a fine product for browsing but not more.\\n',\n",

Dropbox giving 27GB space free with this and One drive gives 5 gb space So all one needs is an extended warranty ( bought for 1500 on Amazson) and a optional Pendrive ( bought a 64 GB) for storing documents etc. Bought in exchange so paid Rs.23,236 ( Rs.4760 for old Sony Viao plus some SBI card discount), so really happy with my purchase. Good screen and battery backup. Only miss not having a backlit keyboard, rest all is great!\\n',\n",
       " \"The HP laptop, 14 inch, light weight and genuine softwares is a perfect combination for anybody who is in search for a decent laptop.After couple of days of working, here is what I found,Pros:1. Windows 10 & MS-Office 2019 both genuine2. Light weight, quite handy if you have to carry it everyday3. Island keys for keyboard, if you have a lot of typing as daily core then it works very smoothly4. Alphabets are engraved with broader font size5. Decent display, webcam and battery life of about 3-4 hCons:1. The smokey gray colour of the lappy is certainly hopeless so that you think to return it on the same grounds, jet black could be excellent option which seems to be unavailable at the moment on Amazon with the present configuration2. Performance is bit on the slower side considering the configuration though addition 4 GB RAM can boost it. However, not a serious problem3. Hardware though light weight seems fragile and of low quality4. Not for heavy gamersVerdict:Certainly value for money. I've reduced two stars for the design of the lappy hardware otherwise perfect companion at the cost.\\n\",\n",

I even tried contacting hp but did not get much help as it was screen sharing session.I consulted one of my friend to it, he helped me out in increasing laptop's speed, he actually removed all unwanted/unnecessary software which were pre installed. Like, McAfee (Not needed when you already have built in Windows defender), some unwanted game software and then he did fragmentation in order to utilize space holes in memory.It really worked and I am able to use the software which I need in a quick of time.You can try this to increase the system performance.

       " 'I am a software professional and I like this product for its light weight and faster booting time. However I can not like its camera quality. it is very poor. After 4 days when I booted it started its own updating of BIOS straight from HP and for reasons I could not understand . At the same time its OS windows updated itself which is not a surprise. Some of its claimed features like integrating with my mobile on an instant basis is NOT happening even after several attempts by me , which is not surprising considering Windows commercial nature and its cunning features. I do not know  for what reasons but sometimes it suddenly loses its contact to internet by wi-fi which feature  I am  using on regular basis as a default one. I bought it because its has MS OFFICE which updates itself because it has come loaded with it. Otherwise Microsoft breaks your computer if you had loaded it from your friends CD. I tis very fast ,very light and jet black colour is very attractive. Arrived one day before in good condition but they should have supplied a bag for free.\\n',\n",

       " \"I ordered this laptop on May 11 (Saturday) and the product reached to me early morning on May 13 (Monday), so kudos to Amazon's delivery! I was worried about any damages or scratches, but the laptop was well packed.Coming to the laptop, I'm writing this review after using it extensively for 2 weeks. My review is divided into the pros and cons to cover all the features of this laptop:Pros:1) The laptop is light as a feather and easy to carry. The body is slim and the metallic look gives it a premium feel.2) The boot time is extremely fast. It takes around 4-5 seconds for the Homescreen/Password screen to pop-up.3) The 256 GB SSD drive. It was primarily the reason why I chose this laptop.4) The touch is brilliant and extremely responsive. The inking pen has a quick response as well. If you're a designer, the inking pen can act as an added benefit, however, for me, it does not have any other utility than to play around with Paint 3D.5) Multifunctioning is smooth and the laptop doesn't lag or slow down when switching from one application to another.6) The 2-1 feature is also good and you can use it as a tablet easily.7) Windows 10 interface is extremely easy to use and you can download some Android games and apps as well from the apps store.8) You get 1 USB 3.1 Type-C, 2 USB 3.1, 1 HDMI and 1 SD card reader on the sides, so connectivity is easy.9) The Battery life is good too, but it really depends upon your usage. My laptop was at 92% battery and I binge-watched a show for 6 hours without the need to plug in the charger.10) The keyboard is also well-spaced and you can get used to the spacing in a short while. My main work involves typing (content writing) and I didn't feel any change in my typing speed.Cons:1) The screen- The screen is only HD and not FHD, so if you like watching 1080p videos, you won't get that full HD experience.2) There is no IPS or In-Plane Switching feature. The screen quality shifts with the slightest change, so you need to keep the screen in one angle to enjoy your video content. Even the slightest shift to the angel can lead to a change in contrast and black levels. So, not a comfortable experience overall.3) The volume is fine. It's not loud enough to play audios and videos for a large room full of people. You'll need a good speaker for your entertainment.4) The laptop heats up a lot when plugged into charging to a really uncomfortable level. You can't use the laptop on your lap while it's charging, especially in summers. I had to put the laptop in front of an Air Conditioner to cool it down a little.5) Though the laptop is sturdy, I'd suggest you avoid using the 2-1 feature multiple times at once. (just saying)Overall, there are more pros than cons of this laptop. The biggest minus point for me is the screen. I focused on the 256 GB SSD and didn't pay heed to the screen resolution and IPS. But, It's a good buy and I'm using it for both entertainment and work without any major concerns.This is a really good laptop if you wish to buy a 2-in-1 laptop and have a budget of 40-45k, but you can buy an FHD display with the 14-dh0101TU model that has the same specs as this one. I don't understand why the 101TU model wasn't launched with this and launched only a few days after it!\\n\",\n",
       " 'I bought it for my sister, she is a freelancer and I must appreciate the look first. I have used it for few hours and find so much comfortable in using, writing and overall accessibility of it. The built, texture and look of the laptop is quite premium. The touch screen is quick. It turns into a tablet very much quick and keyboards get disabled, so you don;t have to worry about keyboards getting pressed mistakenly while using it as a tablet.It is FHD, the visuals are good. The speed so far I have pretty much enjoyed.I recommend this laptop for students, freelancers, artists, writers and also good for traveling.It could be bit more lightweight but then, the cost must be high, so I give it that.the pen works cool. I am going to try more of it over the months, then see how it goes further.Overall, It is a must buy considering the price, brand, specifications, value for money and overall what you are getting here. If you want more specifications, you can go for i5 version or 8GB RAM version, but this model overall is cool\\n',\n",
       " 'This is a preliminary review as I have just received the laptop and played on it for a day. It looks beautiful and slim. 2 in 1 looks very good, as a tablet with inking technology, it is amazing. Pen is good, it will be better to add a screen guard as we need to force the touch of the pen to the screen. This is my first i3 as I have always used i5 or i7, speed seems to be fine but have to see after loading bunch of software. SSD hard disk will be definitely a boost, planning to throw another 4gb ram stick to make it 8gb to compensate i3 performance. So far so good, will update later.First edit:It does not have backlit keyboard and modifying hardware like adding RAM or adding bigger SSD is very difficult in this model, just found all X360 hp laptops are compact and tightly packed like mobile phones. Battery is placed inside and could not be replaced easily like other or older hp laptops. This is definitely an inconvenience for people who are computer savvy and keep updating their laptops.\\n',\n",
       " \"I think, It's a great deal and works like a charm. I was skeptical before buying this but overall it is a good buy if your budget is between 40k-50k as it comes with corei3 8th Gen,MS Office, Windows 10,360 degree, Tablet and touch screen with pen.. so what else we need..I did not feel any slowness as well so far.. However this review is based on 3 days of use.. so wait and see if someone is writing after a month.. but we can buy it👍\\n\",\n",
       " \"first thing first -performance of this machine is same as an i3 with ssd has to be -no complaints there. Its a Very good looking laptop. you will surely love it.But Biggest letdown is display. Let me tell you that if you are considering a laptop then look for full HD display.this one has HD display which provides so so images. The let down by display is visible all over.more to that the Glass on display is pathetic-as it reflects everything . It makes viewing so difficult that it keeps you annoyed all the time.i will update more as i get  more of it.UPDATE:- i am using it now for a considerable time.My biggest complaint was display and let me admit honestly that i am now used to it. i do not find it that annoying. But yes, i would still suggest to go for FHD laptop with few bucks more.Actually HP should have given FHD at this price point.(i bought this at 43K).Touch screen is gd. i am not using the Stylus at all,i think this will be case with every other customers. (samsung Galaxy Note owners know it well).the stylus -its there , because its just there,actual use is minimal.). So while purchasing don't get distracted with HP pen. its not an advantage unless you really require it.\\n\",\n",
       " 'I m very much satisfied with laptop...fine touch screen....stylus pen working excellent........keyboard very sleek......video quality up to the mark...works very well for writing taking notes.....browsing is very fast....got it for 40700 on prime day\\n',\n",
       " 'I got the laptop for 42990 which is a fair deal and as usual Amazon is awesome. First let me give you the cons.Cons:1) The speaker gets muffled when in tablet mode. So, better placement of speakers would have been nice.2) Upgrading the ram by yourself will void the warranty.3) The pen uses AAAA batteries which are ridiculously expensive and only come in 2 packs. That means by the time you exhaust one battery, the second will expire.4) For an i3, the laptop heats up fairly quickly and the fan stays on the whole time.5) The type c port does not support charging which is a bummer because it makes using a power bank unlikely.6) the viewing angles could have been better.Now the pros:1) The touch screen is awesome.2) Best use case is for studying and MS Office work.3) The latency of the pen is very less almost on par with the Apple pencil.4) The track pad uses windows precision drivers.5) Speakers are good but only in laptop mode.6) MS office is inlclude.Overall worth it.\\n',\n",
       " 'Initially I had an issue with activation of Office. Very pleased with feedback provided on my review. Was able to activate MS Office. It does come with MS installed and usable. Hence changed the rating from 1 star to 5 stars. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.The unit is very lightweight. I was looking for a reasonably priced 2 in 1. Overall a very good value for money. The 4 GB of RAM seems a bit insufficient. Else, it serves my purpose of using the system mainly for documentation, spreadsheets and presentations. Yet to try out the pen..EARLIER INITIAL REVIEW.... Changed as above!!!By reading product details we get the impression that MS Office comes a part of the purchase. This representation is completely misleading. However, it is only that Office is installed, we need to purchase and activate. The product details etc. are to be changed to clearly indicate this.Note: We just got the delivery last evening. The review will be changed if in case we find the activation key or if the seller provides the same.\\n',\n",

       " \"At best an average product. Turned up with dead pixels on screen when switched on out of box. HP support says to contact Amazon. Amazon agent sets up replacement but no-one turns up to collect it back. Better to buy directly from manufacturers website instead of Amazon or third party retailers as in case of any out of box issues you will be shuttling between the two without a resolution.
